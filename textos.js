        titulo: "Embrace Your Shadows",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Earth is a School Planet, where souls came to experience duality, that is, to alternately live the polarities between Light and Shadow. Beyond the forgetting of past life experiences, the difficulty that incarnated beings face increases as they also feel disconnected from the Source and do not know who they truly are or what they came here to do. Following the Creator's Plans, this School will leave the category of Expiations and Trials. The level of consciousness will move to a broader level and this will make a great difference from now on. A large part of humanity has already learned the necessary lessons, even if they do not even remember. They cannot yet remember the learning acquired in past lives, but there has always been evolution of consciousness, even in incarnations where shadow dominated the consciousness of the incarnated being. The sum of learning within hundreds or even more than a thousand incarnations that humanity has lived will determine the frequency of each consciousness in these final times of 3D vibrations. There will be a mass ascension of souls, as around one third of humanity has reached this frequency. The Light is gradually increasing in intensity, as the pulses are more intense and more frequent. Elevated vibrations of this Light will keep Earth in a higher Dimensional frequency, which will permanently remain between 5D and 9D. The Old 3D Cycle will be extinct on this Planet. As the Light increases, in the same proportion, the ready consciousness expands. In this way, everything changes for those who awaken to the New Time. Knowledge will emerge from within, for it has always been there. The experiences acquired in duality will serve in a certain way as validation for this awakening. But they will also be of great value in a future when the ascended ones of Earth will be part of the categories of Ascended Masters. As consciousness expands now, each incarnated being integrates their consciousness into their higher soul versions. We will gradually cease to be a soul fragment to become a higher soul version. This is necessary in order to be part of the Worlds of Regeneration, or Fifth Dimension. We can already access these higher versions of ourselves. Some can reach the HIGHER SELF, which is the version at the top of the ascensional Pyramid. This version is housed in the Source and is nothing more than the integral Spirit, that is, the Divine Seed Atom. We are returning home! This is the long-awaited time since we came to this Planet. So, if we can access our Higher Selves, we will also have revived the memories of all past lives here on this Planet of Expiations and Trials. All successive lives will return like a movie in our consciousness. As we are ready to remember and understand our own history, it will play on the screen of each consciousness. And in this movie of each one's life, we will discover that in duality we lived the polarities. If we had advances in learning, we also had setbacks or mistakes. But this is absolutely normal, for there is no other way to learn in this Third Dimension school. Every time we experienced the polarity submerged in Shadow, we built a version called the LOWER SELF. Yes, now we can receive such information, for our consciousness is ready to understand this. Nothing more natural, since the positive polarity provided the experience of the HIGHER SELF. The Soul is ready for ascension when it has experienced and understood all the lessons lived in both polarities, both in Light and in Shadow. You would not know the difference between them if you had not gone through both. This is what now determines who goes to the New 5D Earth and who must still continue learning in Third Dimension Worlds. Yes, you who read or hear this message have been through all of this. Now you are in the final stretch of the journey. Therefore, it is time to clean out the basements, that is, to illuminate the dark parts lived when you touched the shadow polarity. Do not worry about acts and actions that today would be abhorred. Remember that they were necessary for learning in this School. Many of these shadows will arise in your consciousness now, for they need to be illuminated. Before your entire history is remembered in detail, these shadows need to be welcomed, understood, and illuminated. They are part of you. Therefore, they cannot be forgotten. The new symptoms can also vary from person to person. The most common is the feeling that there is some dark Spirit nearby. Yes, it really seems like an attack, for attacks always existed before. But it is necessary to understand that the Umbral realms are being emptied and there are not as many as before. What is happening now is that the LOWER SELF is manifesting in order to be understood and illuminated. That which seems to be an evil Spirit is nothing more than a version of your LOWER SELF. YOUR SHADOW! It represents that soul version in a certain incarnation, when the experience in duality was in the Shadow polarity. Yes, you lived this experience! You lived the lower version in order to learn the difference between Light and Shadow. Were it not for such experiences, you would not be ready for ascension now. You would be among the two thirds who will still need the Third Dimension. So, instead of entering doubt and panic, enter the loving vibration of welcoming. EMBRACE YOUR SHADOWS! See these lower versions of yourself with love and compassion. Do not deny this version of yourself, for it is no longer real. It is just a memory of something that once was. But if you feel something pressing you, understand, accept, and let it go. Do this lovingly! There is no obsessing Spirit disturbing you. It is a memory of a hard time, where the experience, although important and necessary, should no longer be repeated, for it represents the antithesis of LIGHT. It is your opposite, for you are LIGHT! And that is why you feel it as something heavy, for it is a lower, denser energy. Remember that we have five weeks to illuminate such shadows. Resisting will cause them to continue for longer. It is a unique opportunity, for before it was necessary to access them to illuminate them. Now they come to the surface without you looking for them. The shadows need the Light. They are asking for this gesture of charity from you. Release them and your energy will be much lighter. All of this is part of the final adjustments that the moment requires. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Greatest Tragedy: Not Saving Your Own Soul",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The evolution of worlds is a natural process. Everything is according to the Creator's plans. Absolutely nothing escapes, not even the smallest details. He would never leave the humanity that inhabits each of these Worlds helpless. In the specific case of our World, Planet Earth, besides having been throughout all times a School of Trials and Expiations, there was the aggravating factor of the Archon invasion about 350 thousand years ago. This made this school even harder, but no less interesting. It increased the degree of difficulty, but this will make the souls of Earth even stronger and recognized throughout the Universe as great winners. The dark entities remained here for so many millennia because the Divine Plan allowed it. During this period, many fallen entities made their return to the Father's house. Through the loving human feeling, natural in each being belonging to Terran humanity, such dark entities were touched in their core and, in this way, activated the key of return. It is certain that most of these entities did not take advantage of such opportunities. The permission to remain on Earth has ended for such hardened races. The Planetary Transition requires a change of frequency here and they do not possess such vibration. Nothing and no one can stop a Planetary Transition, for it is part of the evolution of Worlds. Earth's humanity would learn in duality without the presence of such races. It would be much easier and simpler. However, with the Archon invasion, the difficulty increased greatly, since the dark ones took the Planet for themselves and enslaved the native population. We became hostages to them for all these millennia. We fought for survival while they exploited us through fear and slave labor. Possessors of reverse technologies, they dominated everything that could serve as aid to human souls. They created dependencies that did not exist before. Through fear, hunger, and control, they obtained total obedience. They modified genetics to create hybrids who would represent them among the command classes within the powers constituted by society. Knowing that their time is running out rapidly, they intend to literally leave a scorched earth scenario. Causing the greatest possible damage to the Planet and its humanity. Remembering also that they take pleasure in human suffering. Devoid of emotions, the only pleasurable sensation is demonstrating their unlimited power. In all known tragedies, there was always participation from the Cabal, the top command organization among the incarnated. Such command never changes owners, for it always belonged to the reptilian hybrids who were created for such purpose. When one leaves the scene, there is always a replacement at the same level. And so millennia after millennia passed. Earth's climate was also altered through reverse technologies within a project called HAARP. Such mechanisms can intensify the centers of Low Atmospheric Pressure and High Pressure as well. With this modification, the entire climate of the Planet can be controlled. By modifying the climate, an ideal scenario for controlling food and abundance is created. Through hunger and fear were the easiest ways to control all of humanity. Now they desperately try to stay in command. They threaten humanity in every way. They believe they can still reverse the situation of planetary transition. They wish to continue here. Even though nothing will change Earth's destiny, tragedies are still part of a widely used narrative. They announce the possibility of horrors and bad news is the undisputed priority within the Media that serves them. There is no need to say here, for any of you can attest to this in your daily life. Any means of communication, out of every 10 news items, 9 are about tragedies. Real tragedies, even if they were caused by mechanisms controlled by the Cabal. But there are also catastrophic predictions created solely with the intent of spreading fear and worries. Always remembering that fear is the best way to control a people. We have written here many times that no prophecy made before 2012 will be confirmed. Earth's Timeline was changed in 2010. Thus, the Planetary Transition will be as smooth as possible. Yes, there will still be natural events as always, for Earth now needs to adjust. As the HAARP system modified the entire natural mechanism of Earth, now, as it is deactivated, Gaia's consciousness needs to readjust its frequency again. This will still cause some extreme events, but then everything will be in perfect harmony as it should always have been. It is the end of an era and the beginning of a New Age! Do not fear tragedies, for they will indeed come to an end! The greatest tragedy that a human being can face is undoubtedly a very personal tragedy: NOT SAVING YOUR OWN SOUL. This will indeed be fatal, for we are in the last incarnation within duality. There are only two paths now: either you go to the New Earth, or your destiny will be exile. Keep your vibration as high as possible. It is your frequency that will determine which of these paths your soul will follow. No one can change your destiny except yourself. Your choices will be decisive. Forget the tragedies they throw upon humanity. Each one will go through what they need to go through. Each one will be where they should be. But do not forget that the greatest tragedy would be not saving your own soul. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Quantum Healing",
        texto: "Beloved ones! We have indeed entered the Quantum phase within the Planetary Transition. As the energies of the Third Dimension dissipate, dimensional frequencies of Fifth Dimension and above flood Earth and its humanity. Nothing that was known until now will last for long. Old beliefs will give way to the NEW, which is already being installed in all Systems on this transforming Planet. Carbon-based Energy will give way to crystalline energy that has a silicon base. Our human bodies will have a new DNA that will replace the current one, changing to GNA (galactic DNA), and will change from two to 12 helices. The decisive phase may be this one we are living now. It will be the year of rebirth and this means that what must cease to exist will undergo a definitive reset. Rebirth means dying to the old and being born to the new. Many will indeed feel a sensation of apparent death. The ego is what will feel all these changes the most. That is why it will resist as much as it can. And this resistance will be the cause of the strongest symptoms that the body will feel and that many are already feeling for some time now. Everything will be quantum in the Fifth Dimension. Few still understand what quantum means, for minds continue to think in 3D. And as we have said before, a 3D mind cannot understand 5D reality. But gradually, more and more people begin to understand and nothing will hold back what is to come. Soon, we will recognize our innate powers. We will discover that we are magnificent healers, exemplary replicators, and fantastic co-creators. The pioneers in this New Science, which encompasses body, soul, and Spirit, are the so-called holistic therapists, especially those who master Quantum Physics. Quantum is a term that imposes no limits, for it encompasses the infinite. We are all immortal, unlimited beings and therefore, quantum. We are becoming aware of this gradually, for the veils dulled and limited consciousness in this Third Dimension World. The bridge that leads to 5D is already under our feet. It is time to tune in to the reality that emerges at great strides. For several years we have been bringing here channelings about the changes and the next steps we must take. Although they are just simple recommendations, they have served grandly for those who strive on the path of ascension. A few days ago, we said here about the importance of this year. It will be a marker and divider of time. The before and after will be remembered by all those who are advancing to 5D. It was also said that the first five weeks would be of confrontation and illumination of our shadows. And now, in today's text, I bring something about QUANTUM HEALING. The time of palliatives is being left behind. We need to take longer and deeper steps. We need to take quantum steps. The emotional body also needs to be adjusted in order to speed up the change of your DNA to GNA, for we are formed by many bodies beyond the physical. The emotional body carries the impressions of pain and suffering lived in past lives. And this reflects in current days, for only by feeling can we recognize that that pain is still part of the soul's baggage. As transpersonal memories, they continue to influence our current quality of life. We cannot enter 5D without dissolving such 3D energies still remaining from times gone by. Even though we can dissolve them over time, there are Quantum Healing techniques that make the process quick and efficient. One of these techniques that helps the most is the QUANTUM HEALING JOURNEY. Highly trained therapists who know the quantum process can help a lot at this moment. Holistic therapists will see their work intensified enormously, for the demand will be great. Anyone can heal themselves without spending a penny. Just learn some technique and be willing with discipline and time to fulfill it. Healing depends on the efforts that each one puts into their purposes. External help is always very valuable, but the will of each person is always decisive. Remember that Christ said: To each according to their efforts. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Each Soul's Plan",
        texto: "Beloved ones! We call Soul Plan the INCARNATION PROJECT that each soul makes for itself before each reincarnation. In Third Dimension worlds, learning takes place under the limitation of consciousness, under the veil of forgetfulness, and subjected to duality, that is, to polarities. Thus, the soul when incarnated does not remember who it is or what it came here to do. But the Divine Laws take charge of bringing all the situations it requested within its Soul Plan. The 3D Earth represents the home of incarnated souls. The 4D is Earth's astral plane, where souls go after disincarnation. It is in 4D that the soul, without the physical body, can expand its consciousness to the point of remembering other previous lives and can also foresee the future that encompasses enough time to live a next incarnation. Based on the learning acquired in past existences, the still existing pendencies, and the future scenario it will face, the soul makes an INCARNATION PROJECT so perfect that it encompasses infinite possibilities. However, each possibility will always lead to the main objective of reincarnation, that is, to the result that will elevate it even if only a few steps on the evolutionary scale. When the soul completes the age of second childhood, that is, at 14 years old, it is considered responsible for its choices. Then begins the phase of exercising free will and that is also where its choices begin to weigh. The Soul Plan is so comprehensive that every day and every hour different possibilities arise. According to each choice regarding each situation, the incarnated soul follows a certain destiny, but always in accordance with what it still needs to learn or redeem, taking into account that life is only one, always continued, even considering multiple reincarnations. Nothing that happens in the daily life of the incarnated is chance. Everything is always within what was planned before. What really makes the difference is the choice decided at each moment. The paths of ascension can be multiple, but the objective is always unique. The soul can even make the choice not to evolve in a certain incarnation. We call this stagnation. No one goes through what they do not need to go through and also no one escapes from themselves. No one dies before the stipulated deadline, for the soul asked for the necessary time to fulfill its project. Only suicide can change this deadline. There is an important detail that we need to observe here. Within the Soul Plan, as there are infinite possibilities, the time of bodily life can also be extended or reduced, even without suicide. Yes, this is due to the choices that each incarnated person makes. Remembering that there are infinite possibilities to reach the final objective within each incarnation. There is still, in a certain way, something we could call debits and credits acquired as surpluses within the current incarnation. The more credits, the more merits to settle certain pending redemptions. The more debits, the more need to produce something positive to amortize them. Finally, in life's accounting, everything adds or subtracts in perfect mathematics. We can then summarize everything in a single phrase: ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING THAT MAKES YOU DESERVING! In this way, you will always have credit and life becomes much smoother and more pleasurable. We cannot know our plan, for it is in the subconscious. But the Universe presents us daily with the situations that are inserted in it. That is all! We also do not know when and how we will disincarnate and this is also fundamental, for it would be torment to know the day and hour or even the way we will do it. However, when a situation has already been overcome, depending on merit and also on non-interference in our choices, we can access information about our own Soul Plan. Understand this; accept each opportunity; make at least a minimum effort in each need for change; understand that often not everything is choices, for necessary redemptions are also part of the Plan; finally, accepting each situation as a real opportunity for evolution will always lead us to the best. The best of ourselves. And that is enough to understand life. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Portals of Ascension",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Talking about Portals is increasingly in vogue. Certainly, it was not a common subject a few years ago and the few times one heard about it were only in so-called fiction movies. The idea one had about Portals was simply an imagination of something outside reality. Imagine entering a Portal and instantly appearing in another dimension! The consciousness of a humanity restricted to the Third Dimension is by itself limited between 1 and 2%. It is part of the Divine Plan within the evolution of worlds. However, there was an aggravating factor with the Archon invasion about 350 thousand years ago. Earth's humanity, already very limited in its consciousness, suffered a mental reprogramming imposed by them in order to obtain remote control of their activities and actions. Many call this primary implants. But it is nothing physical, for the human mind itself reacts according to such programming. Over the millennia, beliefs and repetitions of paradigms made a collective hostage to the Dominating System. As I have said many times: The predator will not run after you; he simply implants a System that by itself works in the collective, making all incarnated beings hostages of this programming. Such implant is installed in the Pineal Gland, also called the Third Eye. There is the Frontal Chakra, which is the Multidimensional Portal that connects each incarnated human being to the Source and also to their higher versions of themselves. It is through the Third Eye that we expand consciousness and connect with the other Divine Beings who support and guide us. Once this Portal is controlled by the Archons, our connection is interrupted and control is naturally established through limited consciousness within 3D reality. There are those who believe that such implants can be removed through some technique. I can say that this is impossible. What will dissolve the implant is the expansion of consciousness. Only you can do this and it takes a lot of will and determination. Dissolving the primary mind control implant also requires some external help, beyond the Planet, which comes through the increased incidence of Photonic Light. Such event is already happening. This will make it easier for those who are determined to seek their ascension and conquer their liberation from the reptilian yoke and dominion. When the Archons arrived here, they also promoted an inclination of Earth's magnetic axis so that the Light would be partly suppressed, as it was, in a way, diverted by the degree of inclination. Currently, the Positive Galactic Forces are moving Earth's magnetic axis again and placing it in its original position. And with the arrival and increase of Photon Light, the great opportunity is created to dissolve the primary implants. This fact is proven through the gradual increase of souls that currently awaken on this Planet. Even so, to dissolve these implants will depend on each one's desire. And the first step will certainly be the breaking of all belief systems. Lies and fear are the main tools used by the dominators. This is how they keep the entire flock inside the same enclosure. Over the millennia, the flock does not remember and no longer believes that there is a world of freedom out there. The increase of Photonic Light and the repositioning of Earth's axis to its original position bring a natural restlessness to each consciousness and this creates a favorable condition for seeking something more. This condition is enough for all those who seek their freedom as free souls to take the first steps towards ascension. With a little will and determination, the implants are dissolved and nothing and no one can imprison you again. As consciousness expands, the Archons lose control and dominion over that soul. This is also their greatest fear. No power used until now will reverse the ascension of an awakened soul. When we say that Earth is being freed from the dark ones, we are affirming that nothing will prevent what is to come. Since 2012, the Light intensifies every day. It will culminate with the arrival of the Great Solar Flash that will break the last veils that cover controlled consciousness. It is certain that only one third of humanity is ready for ascension, but at least the dominion of Darkness on this Planet comes to an end. Even those who will have to continue their learning in Third Dimension worlds will have a planetary home free from these horrible shadows. The Portal of Ascension is closer every day for a good part of humanity. Before it, we have already passed through many smaller Portals and, by crossing them, we approach the one that will be the last and definitive. Yes, Portals are not fiction as was believed! They are real, just as real is everything that we believed to be mere fiction. Meanwhile, everything they made us believe was real, soon we will prove was nothing but an illusion. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Each One's Tools",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Throughout life, each human being receives tools according to their incarnation project. This Soul Plan is elaborated in the Astral, that is, even before incarnating. Logically, once in matter, the soul no longer remembers its own plan. This is the secret that few understand. And we also notice that many do not accept it. The Terran School is one among those that offer such learning. With each reincarnation, the soul lives a unique reality, as if it were the first time coming to this Planet. And forgetting past lives is fundamental, for if one remembered, there would be little or no point in being here. In the period between lives, after passing through the 4D Portal, the soul without the physical body achieves a certain expansion of consciousness, sufficient to remember its last incarnations. After a certain period that varies for each soul, it begins to understand its process and its incarnations. And it is based on this personal history that the soul elaborates a new plan for a new incarnation. Once again incarnated, the veils once more cover its consciousness, making it forget its own current project. But Divine Laws are wise and never abandon anyone. Being here in matter, every day, infinite possibilities arise for each soul. And, according to the choices each one makes, appropriate tools are offered so that they can complete such tasks. It does not matter what each one does or fails to do during bodily life. What matters is how they will use the tools that are made available to them. If Earth is a School Planet, all subjects will have to be learned. This is the condition for achieving approval and the ascension of the soul to a higher level. Knowing that we are in a 3D Dimension, where Duality is the basis of learning, obviously in this school we must learn what it is really like to live the polarities, that is, sometimes at one extreme, sometimes at the other. And so, we experience all possibilities within what is known as GOOD and EVIL. Many prefer to speak of right and wrong, but in duality there are no mistakes, THERE IS LEARNING! Mistakes are our best teachers. They are the ones who teach us most quickly. By making mistakes and getting things right, humanity learns to walk the center line, which is the straight line of ascension. Learning from the mistake releases the obligation to repair it through the pain of redemption. The big problem, and this one does bring the need for painful redemption, is the insistence on the mistake. But there also is a choice. Human beings have the tendency to complicate what is already easy by nature. And what leads them to such attitudes invariably are their personal interests. Greed, the desire for power, vanity, pride, in short, all the possibilities that place them above others are the great risk that everyone runs while incarnated. As I wrote at the beginning of the text, even forgetting the Soul Plan, all necessary tools are made available to us during the journey within an incarnation. When we use them harmoniously, we are taking the straight path of loyalty to the divine. However, when we use them for our own benefit, that is, to bargain, take advantage, or to the detriment of others, then we assume responsibility for mandatory redemptions in the future. There is a phrase attributed to Christ Jesus: To whom much is given, more will be required. It is true! Let us compare in a practical way: having a Lord of lands with many employees, he will distribute various tools to each worker. Obviously, he will demand more from the one who received a tractor compared to the one who received a hoe for daily tasks. Even so, what the one with the hoe did will also be evaluated. If he used it improperly, for example, pulling up the cultivated plant instead of the weed, he will obviously be reprimanded. The one with the tractor also, if he did not use his tool according to his abilities. It does not matter what tools you have. What really matters is WHAT YOU WILL DO WITH THEM. This is where the secret of life lies. It is not because the dark ones hindered your journey that you will now find excuses or justifications for the failures that occurred. Only you have responsibility for the results according to what was offered and allowed to you. So, we begin to understand that life is not complicated. We are the ones who complicate it when we mix other interests beyond what was determined only for learning. Ambition always puts everything at risk. Do not complicate your ascension even more. Responsibility, self-denial, patience, persistence, and confidence are and will always be indispensable ingredients on the path of evolution. The rest is nothing but unnecessary baggage that only delays the long journey of life. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Tragedy of Petropolis",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The planetary home is being adjusted to the new frequencies, as everything accelerates now within Earth's Transition. Many still do not understand the dimension of a Planetary Transition and, therefore, it becomes even more difficult to understand the consequences related to the ascension process. In truth, we are in the final phase of the Transition and it is because of this that so many events happen. They are events necessary for the energetic adjustment, whether for the physical bodies of humans or for Gaia's body. We have talked here in recent years about the cleansing of old energies. And you are a witness to this, for you have gone through and still go through adjustments in your physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual body. How much change in such a short space of time! When you look back, and you do not need to go very far, just a year or a little more, and you no longer recognize yourself. Everything is accelerated! Ashtar Sheran said about a little over two years ago that now what used to take centuries can take only a few months or weeks. What was yesterday may no longer be today. And what is today will already be different tomorrow. It was also said that human beings are healing their ancestry in order to adjust the energies and adapt them so that they can pass through the 5D Portal. All the pains and traumas of the past must be healed and illuminated, for if before they were necessary, now they no longer make sense. The period of Trials and Expiations is ending. A New Earth emerges and the Era of Light is already being announced. The bride is being prepared for the great wedding feast. It is the moment when she will receive all the looks and attention of everything around her. Humanity is represented here by the bride. Mother Gaia is also this bride. It is time to celebrate and feast on this long-awaited time! Yes, Earth has never gone through a Transition before! Incarnated souls go through the Transition process in this current existence. The adjustments are felt in their physical bodies. You know very well how this happens, for many feel the symptoms of ascension. Many feel the discomfort of this energetic and frequency adjustment. Gaia's body is everything we know as Planet. All Kingdoms are part of this planetary body. Each animal, each plant, each mineral, and each human is a living cell of her body. They compose her organs and, just as in a human being, constitute Gaia's material body. The Kingdoms known as nature are harmonious by themselves. But there is the kingdom composed of men, who, once endowed with a soul in experience in duality, provoke polarities within their actions, and this directly affects Gaia's body. They are the constant wounds and injuries that we cause to Gaia's body and this causes negative energy bubbles, which she needs to constantly purge. And so, all natural phenomena are nothing more than the result of this purging. The winds, the tides, the rains, and so many other events serve as natural cleansing of Gaia's body. And when a deeper cleansing becomes necessary, the harder phenomena occur, such as earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, tornadoes, or extreme events of rain, floods, severe droughts, and even uncontrollable fires. Some localized events may also be necessary in order to dissolve negative miasmas, caused by the collective psyche or resident groups that bring from their actions in past lives the need for cleansing. When reincarnating and settling in the same region, they need to redeem their past pendencies. As they live close to each other, this stagnant energy in each soul asks for passage in order to be released. And Mother Gaia, who is MOTHER, always wants the best for her children. By taking upon herself the pain of each one, she accumulates this dense energy in the form of a bubble, until at a certain moment this bubble bursts. This always happens through a natural event, which we can compare to a pustule that releases the secretions of an inflamed wound. Even if we see such an event as a tragedy, in truth it is always a healing. Both for those who suffer its effects directly or indirectly, and for Gaia's body, which also manages to get rid of that discomfort that troubled her. Those who suffer nothing in these situations have nothing that linked them to the actions of the past. Even so, they have the opportunity to exercise charity and citizenship. Exercising solidarity even helps to free oneself from some still pending redemptions that would necessarily come to them as well at some point further ahead. Those who take advantage of bargaining over such misfortunes will certainly considerably multiply their debts and the redemptions ahead will be as or more painful compared to these that are happening now. Mother Gaia has always welcomed her children in this Third Dimension body. For her, we have always been her babies who need permanent support. But with the Planetary Transition to a Fifth Dimension World, her babies will become adults and will no longer need unconditional protection. Now, the freedom and responsibility of higher consciousness will no longer cause any action that could hurt Mother Gaia's body. A New Era is already waiting for humanity and the Planet in Regeneration. We are living the final moments of the extinction of an ERA, where pain and suffering were part of the energetic cleansing of each body, including Gaia's body. May we learn the last lessons still pending, through such natural events, for when we do not understand the lesson, it needs to be repeated. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Raising the Frequencies",
        texto: "Beloved ones! At the moment when Earth makes its Transition, and humanity makes its ascension, the variation and changes of everything that surrounds us is visible. However, nothing compares to frequency variations, for they are not seen, but felt. The passage from Third Dimension to Fifth Dimension does not happen suddenly. This would cause the destruction of the Planet and the end of Terran humanity. We have already written about this in previous texts. The Transition takes on average 3 centuries. We are now in the last decades and therefore we can feel it more intensely. The final events of the Transition will coincide with the ascension of a good part of humanity. And all those who are ready to finalize the experiences in a World of Expiations and Trials will also pass to the New Earth, that is, to a Fifth Dimension World. The Old 3D Earth is gradually being replaced by the New 5D Earth. Frequencies rise gradually and then recede so that the incarnated can adapt without suffering the impact of a sudden change. So, we can observe how this happens with each human being. Frequency is not knowledge and much less an individual will. Frequency is a vibration according to the higher or lower consciousness; a more expanded or less broadened consciousness. It is the state of each consciousness that determines the frequency range each one is in. Even so, no one raises their frequency level by jumping. Nor can anyone go up and stay there for a long time. What happens is a gradual advance. It is like taking two steps forward and one back. We advance some frequency bands ever higher and then retreat a little in order to accustom our physical, emotional, and mental bodies. Each line crossed is always a conquest. And, with each conquest, the permanence in that band becomes longer. So, at all times, we have opportunities to advance to small lapses of Fifth Dimension bands, staying there for increasingly longer each time. And when we retreat to 4D and even 3D bands, we are also going to less and less dense bands and we stay there for less and less time. And so humanity walks towards 5D. The time is not far when many will no longer retreat. They will stay longer and longer in the 5D frequency until they definitively leave the lower Dimensions. As we are in transition, the same process does not happen for everyone at the same time. It depends on how each one positions themselves in terms of attitudes, understanding, and vibration. You can observe how your process advances. Do not make comparisons with others. Just observe and feel your vibrations and your reactions according to each moment of your daily life. See how everything changes rapidly from one day to another and even from one hour to another. There are moments of great peace and, soon after, it seems that the world is falling apart. There are moments of great joy and, soon after, a strange sadness takes over you. It alternates moments of great euphoria with moments of discouragement; of total understanding with inexplicable anger; of high confidence with extreme fear, and so many other symptoms. When you rise to Fifth Dimension frequencies, it seems that the world is indeed much better and the feeling of well-being is constant. However, when the frequency returns to lower bands, that is, Third Dimension, the shock is inevitable. The discomfort is felt instantly. Observe how this occurs in your daily life. Do not become discouraged when the frequency band drops. Just understand that you are on a ladder of ascension and going down a few steps does not prevent the climb. Affirming yourself in this climb requires that you go up 2 or 3 steps and then retreat 1 or 2. Even so, the advance continues. Certain things that were once acceptable now begin to become unbearable. The coexistence with certain people, certain types of conversations and subjects, certain places that were previously frequented, certain events, certain types of conduct and also in food and traditional habits now become a burden when you have to endure them. Observe how much you have changed in recent years. Review these old habits and try to imagine yourself doing this now. Surely, you will not be encouraged to repeat them. All of this is unfitting in your current routine. THIS IS INDEED A FREQUENCY CHANGE! You are touching Fifth Dimension bands and staying there for longer and longer each time. And it is becoming increasingly difficult to endure staying in the lower bands, even if it is still necessary to return to them. So someone might say: why not stay only in the 5D vibration bands? Even if it seems reasonable, we are not ready yet. This adaptation is happening gradually. The physical body also needs to adjust to the new DNA (GNA), for from a carbon base it is gradually transforming into a crystal base. Planetary Transition is a grand event that involves the entire Galaxy. And the ascension of the soul is an event that involves the entire Monad of your Spirit. Imagine the two greatest events occurring simultaneously! Indeed, it is not for any simple mortal. This will only be possible for a part of incarnated humanity, precisely the one that is ready and finishing the learning in 3D duality. You who read or hear this message are exactly at this transition point. You are doing this process of advancement, band by band, towards 5D. You are feeling everything that was described here. And it is this process that makes you feel the advances and retreats, for this is the most common formula within the ascension of each soul. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Being Right or Being Happy?",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The phrase that titles today's text has never been so well placed as in current days. Everything becomes a reason for arguments, for everyone wants to be right. It seems that suddenly everyone recognizes themselves as scholars and deep connoisseurs of any subject. One observes by the writing, the meager studies and knowledge of their own language, but there is an opinion that wants to impose itself on all others. When we say that no one can change the consciousness of others anymore, we are indeed transmitting information and not a simple opinion. The current moment of humanity is one of an End of Cycle. The sequence of previous texts brings all the possibilities so that everyone who follows this work can understand what is actually happening with our Planet and its humanity. We are within a Planetary Transition. Earth is ceasing to be a World of Trials and Expiations and will transform into a World of Regeneration. As if that were not enough, the frequencies that were once Third Dimension are gradually starting to vibrate in Fifth Dimension. The change will be total and definitive. It is as if each one of us were transported to another Planet. Nothing will be as it was anymore. In a short time, the humanity that will inherit the New Earth will no longer have the limited consciousness as in the Old Earth. The Photon Light that is already entering our Planet is expanding the consciousness of all souls currently incarnated here. Even without great knowledge, people consider themselves experts on any subject now. Obviously, many are correct in their considerations, for they already possess the innate or acquired knowledge in this current existence. And this further potentiates knowledge. But a large majority has no knowledge base and understanding ends up being distorted. And, for this reason, they also become manipulable. Manipulation is a widely used practice today. The dominators of humanity know very well how to use such artifice. So, they create false information, precisely that which is in their interest. They throw such information to the manipulable masses through the media, which is paid for it. And the already limited beliefs of this mass contribute to disinformation. The vanity and exacerbated ego innate in human beings contribute even more to conflicts of interest and unlimited discussions, always directed to the interests of those whom the mass serves. It has never been like this before. The moment is one of definitions and choices that will lead each human being to a different Timeline. One will follow to the New Earth and the other will lead outside of it, that is, to Planets destined for exile according to the vibration of each one who chooses this path. This is the final moment of the Planetary Transition. If until now something was often defined by shouting, as they said, now there will no longer be this resource. It is useless to want to be right. What will define the compatible Timeline will be each one's frequency. It will not be reason or the lack of it. It will be the state of each consciousness. That is, THE MEEK AND PURE OF HEART, as Christ Jesus said, those who will inherit the New Earth. Do you want to be right or be happy? At least be thoughtful. Think about the possibility that you may be wrong. Know how to recognize that there are still surprises and much more will come. Be open and receptive to information even if it is not in accordance with your beliefs and concepts. If we have been deceived all the time, those who did it want to continue doing so. Do not get into arguments, just observe and so you will see how the world's dominators play. The board is on the table and now the last moves of the game will be shown. But in the broader view of already awakened consciousness, the final result is already known. And nothing and no one can change this, for the entire process of Transition and Ascension is already defined. THE LIGHT HAS WON! When such information is channeled, it is also a way to calm the hearts afflicted by the moment and the expectation of what is to come. We place here CLARIFICATIONS, however, always respecting ethics and respect for everything and everyone. We are not here to be recognized and neither to obtain high audience rates and followers. The objective is only to inform and clarify. If there are only five readers who will understand the message, it will already be good enough. We do not need anyone's approval, for it is enough that it passes through the scrutiny of conscience and responsibility. We also do not aim to convince anyone. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Abundance for All Who Recognize Values",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Even if it is not visible to everyone, we are within the turning of all Systems known until now. We have been talking insistently in the last 6-7 years about the changes in this End of Cycle of Earth. The Planetary Transition is heading towards its conclusion after three long centuries. The most important definitions happen now, in this decade, notably between 2020 and 2025. We understand that many still perceive nothing, for everything is a matter of consciousness and frequency. The changes between 3D and 5D are only visible to those who also broaden their consciousness to higher frequencies. A consciousness trapped in 3D will never perceive and understand something that vibrates in 5D. So we can say that the change is not for everyone, since it is a perception. It would be like being at the foot of a mountain and wanting to see the panorama on the other side. Those who climb to the top can see and describe, as well as understand what is there. Those who do not climb understand nothing, for they do not have the perception of the existing reality in that place. Change is always an opportunity to get rid of something useless in order to add something new and better. It is changes that promote the evolution and progress of everything. If there were no changes, everything would always remain static, that is, the same for an indefinite time. The evolution of worlds and their humanities is only possible because of constant movement. Everything spins in a spiral, from a Galaxy, a Star, a Planet, and even the direction of winds, storms, ocean currents, and even the energies that sustain life. Without movement, there would be no possible life. In this End of Planetary Cycle, there is also a coincidence of the ascension of souls incarnated here. There will be great opportunities for those who are ready in the development of their consciousness. It is estimated that one third of humanity will be ready at the final moment of the Transition. They will be the ones who will inherit the New Earth. The time now is of ABUNDANCE FOR ALL WHO RECOGNIZE VALUES. With the removal of the World's controllers, prosperity will finally come and all those who are ready in their level of cooperative consciousness will be the beneficiaries of abundance. Many understand that abundance and prosperity is only in relation to finances. This is a mistake, for prosperity encompasses everything. Money is just one of the items of abundance. Full satisfaction in the sequence of days, whether in professional life, relationships, perfect health, and yes, also in finances, everything is a package of abundance. It would be useless to have a good bank balance and feel unhappy in other items. We have said many times that the Universe is an excellent administrator of things. It charges, but also knows how to retribute. It is very generous with those who cooperate. And from now on, we will see the end of competition, for it will give way to cooperation. Those who are not aligned with the new frequencies will have many difficulties remaining on this Planet. The Quantum Systems are already in operation and no human action will go without observation and evaluation made by them. The QFS (Quantum Financial System), for example, is already working and it can track all the flow of money in circulation. As it is a Quantum System, nothing and no one can deceive it. I wrote a text two years ago titled: QUANTUM COMPUTER. It would be good to read it again to understand today's text. Everything is being taken into account, even the thoughts and intentions of each human being. It will certainly be this Quantum Computer that will organize the abundance that will come from now on. There will be no mistake; therefore, to each according to their works. THERE WILL BE ABUNDANCE FOR ALL WHO RECOGNIZE VALUES. Yes, this means that all those who vibrate in good and in what is just, that is, all those who practice what we understand as ethical and moral, will also be the ones who will receive abundance. Nothing more fair! Those who take pleasure in evil, who practice injustices or benefit in their own cause will be precisely those who will have nothing more. Some say: but they are already rich! Do not count on that. The new systems will change everything, including the Revalidation of Currencies. Illicit money will not be converted, therefore, it will be worth nothing. It will not even serve as toilet paper anymore. The new poor will be those who will be sitting on real mountains of money; however, without any value. For these, despair will set in. They may at some point become dangerous and will still try some retaliation, but it is not very likely that they will achieve any success, even momentarily. Scammers will no longer be able to cheat. It is the end of the Illuminati! It is the end of the New World Order! The Quantum System is already activated, and in operation. Now, it is a matter of time for everything to indeed be shown. Still, not everyone can see the new reality. Consciousness trapped in Third Dimension cannot understand the new 5D reality. This will only be visible to those who are already in the frequency that leads to the New Earth. Therefore, it will be useless to have discussions between 5D minds and 3D minds. Just understand that everything is in motion and the wheel will not stop until it has reached its destination. Namaste!",

        titulo: "A Personal Healing Testimony",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Everything we have written here in the texts over these 10 years has the objective of informing and clarifying subjects that still find resistance in human minds, since they confront limiting beliefs. In the Third Dimension, a characteristic of limited consciousness is precisely forgetting past lives. If it were not so, nothing would justify a soul incarnating on this Planet of Expiations and Trials, where learning actually takes place in living and in experiences in duality, that is, in polarities. Only now, as the end of this long learning cycle approaches, do human consciousness begin to broaden, and gradually we come to know a little of our soul history. When Kardec codified Spiritism, he brought a little Light to the darkness that surrounded each incarnated soul, showing that we are indeed an immortal soul, and what dies is always only the physical body. Christ Jesus himself said in his time: The end of a time will come and a New Earth will emerge. The meek and pure of heart will inherit this New Earth. He also said: Before the end of times, the COMFORTER will come. The comforter is indeed Spiritism, for it comforts us by showing us that life continues beyond the grave. This continued life is divided into existences of the soul in physical bodies. Today we already have information from the Angelic Supporters that attest to this. On average, each human being currently incarnated has between 600 and 1,100 incarnations on Earth alone. The soul stops reincarnating here when it reaches the degree of consciousness that allows it the frequency of a higher Dimension. This gives it the right to ascend. And now, with Earth's Transition to a World of Regeneration, there is also the opportunity for a large portion of souls to make their ascension. During the Planetary Transition, favorable energetic conditions activate the broadening of consciousness. This allows us to understand the information that arrives, in order to instruct us for what is happening and what is to come. But it does not happen equally for everyone, for there are different degrees of consciousness. Currently, it is already possible to see the large number of people whose consciousness has expanded broadly and this process tends only to grow. The number of those who understand the process of continued life and who know that we are a soul and not just a physical body is large. They understand that we have had many lives here before, even if in other bodies. Today I will tell my story. Perhaps it will serve so that some of you can gain some clarification or some guidance for current and future days. Remembering that 20 years ago I was also still skeptical and was not interested in these subjects that I always bring here in these last years. Let us go to my personal healing testimony, which I was authorized by my Spiritual Team to publicly relate to you who follow me here. I hope this brings you at least a little encouragement and confidence in what is to come. I was born in this current existence in the year 1953. Grandson of an Italian immigrant, resident in the Serra Gaucha, son of small farmers, large family and with few conditions for living in a mountainous place, without any technology other than exclusively manual labor. Isolated from everything, conditions were very limited. Among the male children, I was the oldest. Even before going to school at 8 years old, I remember that work in the fields was daily, for it was also the only form of survival for the large family. So, our father gave us goals, which, if fulfilled, would give us the right to a day off on Sunday. Obviously, with quite a lot of effort, the goal was always achieved. And so, on Sundays, the boys could gather in the small community to play soccer. However, there was a problem: INVARIABLY, EVERY SUNDAY I WAS STRICKEN WITH AN UNBEARABLE HEADACHE, which prevented me from enjoying the day off. This continued until I reached the age of 23, when I got married. Then, the headaches were no longer only on Sundays, but also on some days of the week. And so it got worse and worse, until around my 35-40 years they were almost daily. The only relief I could have was at work, for working relieved the suffering a little. There was nothing that would make this pain go away. There was also nothing that showed up in medical exams. It really seemed like something supernatural. Due to the severe pains, I could not have a social life. So I dedicated myself to work seven days a week, reaching the point of going 21 years without taking a vacation and without missing a single day of work. It was the relief I needed. This remained unexplained until a few years ago. In 2008, at 55 years old, I made the radical change in my life. I have already written here before about the death and rebirth that we can go through even without changing bodies. This is what happened to me 14 years ago. Immersed in the current mission assumed in 2008, I began to understand life as one, even divided into hundreds and even thousands of existences. The reincarnations of the soul made me understand the Laws of Cause and Effect. And so, in 2016, I received the first Spiritual information about my headaches. It was a Sunday and suddenly, as always, there came the migraine. It was so strong that I needed to lie down. And I also blacked out. I do not know for how long I was like that, without remembering anything, but it was a few hours. When I came back from the blackout, I no longer felt pain, but a word was pounding in my mind: Ashtar Sheran; Ashtar Command. I had never seen such words. I could not imagine what they meant. But a few days later I received a message from a person who was also a therapist and told me she had a message from Ashtar Sheran and needed to pass it to me. In short, I learned about my connection with the Pleiadians and with the Ashtar Command. I was also told that 2,700 years ago I attended the School of Knowledge of Master Confucius, Master Lanto, and Master Kuthumi. I prepared myself at that time in order to be incarnated now for the mission of clarification at this moment of finalization of the Planetary Transition. And today I know that Master Lanto is one of the Mentors of my current Team. I was also told that in some incarnation, after going through learning at the School of Knowledge, I needed to exercise such knowledge and let myself be carried away by ego and vanity, using such knowledge for my own benefit. This caused pain and suffering for many people and the redemption chosen for this current incarnation was the severe headaches that accompanied me since childhood. The recommendation was then to work on forgiveness, for many souls were still suffering and wanting revenge. A long work began there. The pains decreased, but did not cease. A few years passed. In 2018, I questioned my Spiritual Team about why this was. The answer took a few months, but it came. They told me exactly with these words: you are a healer. You help people by instructing them. But how could you do better without going through your own self-healing experiences? This is an opportunity you have. Take advantage and heal yourself. So, it was indeed an opportunity to learn to relieve the pains, whenever a crisis arose. Relieve through techniques and not through medications, for that was the learning. And so I was discovering breathing techniques, meditation, relaxation, understanding beyond forgiveness and also through herbal teas that were always intuited according to the moment. As always, the pains ceased with the practices, but eventually returned. Even though the number of crises was decreasing, they constantly returned. And I needed to discover what was still missing. I also worked a lot on healing ancestry. But I still had to face the pain, at least once a week. On December 15, 2021, I wrote a text titled Useful practices in energetic detoxification that describes the symptoms and techniques to relieve their effects. There I already mentioned the med beds. I described that they are available on the Ships around Earth and that you can ask before sleeping to be taken during sleep and undergo the necessary healings. And many do have the merit and are healed. Even though not everyone can yet, we know that everything is a matter of frequency. When that frequency is reached, the cure is certain. In that text I did not mention my experience, for it was not yet time. Actually, I needed to be sure that such information was correct. And today I was allowed to write about it for all of you too. In this way, I hope that at least some of you can also benefit from this self-healing technique. Remembering that all self-healing is certain when the necessary frequency is reached. It was October 2021. I was here doing my daily work of reading and answering the hundreds of daily messages I receive and suddenly I am stricken with a severe headache, an old acquaintance. I stopped everything for there were no more conditions to do anything. I started to meditate and asked my Spiritual Team what this still wanted to teach me. Unlike previous times, the answer that day was immediate. They told me: you know what med beds are. You know how they work. You have already written about it and already told your readers that they can go during sleep to them in order to obtain healings. But why do you need to go during sleep? Why do not you go there now, consciously? You can do this. Do this. That was exactly what I did. I entered meditation and uttered the following words: I Am Vital Frosi. In the name of my soul, in the name of my Higher Self, in the name of the Source and in the name of all Beings of Light, I ask authorization from the Pleiadian Medical Team, in order to be received on the Healing Ship and be submitted to the healing of this headache. I ask to be authorized to be submitted to the Med Bed. Consciously, I moved in thought to a Ship and entered it. I went to a compartment where there was a med bed. It indeed looks like a tomography equipment found in Earth hospitals. I entered it and saw it close. As the material is transparent, I could observe six Pleiadians around it, three on each side, operating the healing machine. I felt it working. It made an incredible sweep of all my bodies, including the non-physical ones. A few minutes passed, I think less than 5. I came out of it and returned in the same way I went there, in thought. I breathed deeply and returned to the normal state of consciousness. And something incredible had happened. THE HEADACHE HAD PASSED LIKE MAGIC. This was proof that the technique works. I was truly enchanted. But I needed the certainty of the cure. I needed to have confidence and patience. I needed to wait, for before it also passed, however, then it returned. And the days went by. Today it has already been five months without the headache. And now they authorized me to write about this too. Remembering that I chose a Pleiadian ship, but there are also the Arcturian Healing teams. They also operate with med beds. The information they give us is that soon the med beds will be available here for everyone, in all cities and sufficient so that there is no waiting line. However, it is not yet time, since big pharma holds dominion over laboratories and the pharmaceutical industry. Everything will change in due time. It is expected to be very soon. But while they cannot come to you, you can go to them. Whether sleeping or awake. And this is possible for I proved it to myself. Try it yourself too. If you do not succeed the first time, persist! When you reach the necessary frequency, the cure is certain. I waited more than 60 years to get the result. Unfortunately I see people giving up in a few days or a few months. Embraces of Light!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! The experience of the soul incarnated on a Third Dimension Planet, where the veil of forgetfulness reduces its consciousness to a mere 1-2%, means that indeed little or nothing can be known beyond the limits of the planetary atmosphere. Possessing a material body, the physical eyes and understanding are limited to what is considered matter. Added to this is the interest of the few who, over the course of millennia, could bring knowledge and offer it to the collective, but used it for their own interests, for it is much easier to control an alienated collective. The human mind, enclosed in a consciousness limited by forgetfulness, has always had difficulty understanding what is outside its perceptions. Because Earth is a Planet on the periphery of the Galaxy, whose magnetic axis is inclined in relation to the incidence of Light emanating from its Central Galactic Sun, everything favored the dormancy of such consciousness. In this way, Terran humanity became easy prey to the Archon domination that arrived here 350 thousand years ago. Coming from the Orion System, such alien races, in their beginning, had their interest focused only on Earth's natural resources. However, over time, they decided to use the work of humans to serve them. Through hybridism, they placed representatives in all command hierarchies among the incarnated. Remembering that such aliens never incarnated in human form, always remaining at the top of the dominating pyramid, even if outside the Earth's Crust. Some Science Fiction books and movies show in a certain way a reality, even if they are considered fiction. The limiting beliefs of 3D consciousness would never allow a human being to understand that reality is there, that is, at least a part of the hidden truth. They made us believe that the only truth was what they showed us over the millennia. They made humanity believe in powers from outside, in the powers of the gods, in the powers of others, but they never told us that the power is within each one. It was necessary for a New Time to arrive. The spiral movements of the Galaxy lead the celestial bodies that surround its periphery inward. And the more inward, the closer to its Central Sun. And this repositioning favors the increase of Light incidence. Light awakens! It wakes up the one who sleeps. If this is so in the real life of the incarnated, so it is also in the immortal soul life of each human being. And as Christ Jesus said two thousand years ago: The end of a Time will come and a New Earth will emerge. A better world, where there will be no pain or suffering. The meek and pure of heart will inherit the New Earth. Two thousand years have passed and that time has arrived! The crystalline Light has intensified and this is visible. The good observer just needs to pay attention to the signs that are noticed more each day. Like the colors of dusk and dawn. The changes in animal behavior. Some natural events that were not so common before. Finally, the change in human behavior, which is undeniable. As they say jokingly: just have two neurons to recognize this. But today I bring you encouragement. You who already feel the broadening of consciousness. You who know and recognize that you are no longer the same as a few years ago. You who have already noticed beyond all external changes, also those internal ones, for you no longer feel the same as before. You are absorbing more of this Photonic Light emanating from the Central Sun. And this is dissipating the veils that limited the perceptions and understanding of what you were never taught. Now your consciousness begins to expand and nothing and no one can keep it limited at the levels of before. This is what scares the dominators of humanity. All the artifices used until now are now proving inefficient. The loss of control leads to despair and makes them dangerous. As they are hybrids, they have cold blood, devoid of emotions. Such a characteristic can cause them to make decisions that negatively impact humanity. The good observer, that is, the one who has a broader consciousness, already perceives this without any difficulty. The separation of the wheat from the chaff is actually the separation by levels of consciousness. And this separation has already happened and is already finalized. Nothing and no one can stop what is to come, for they are from Natural Laws and not from Human Laws. The new consciousness is returning the innate power of each soul. This fact determines the ascension or not of each one. That soul that is determined to follow the changes in progress follows the Timeline of the New Earth. The others follow the Timeline of the Third Dimension and, therefore, will have to reincarnate from now on, on Planets still of Trials and Expiations. For the latter, in fact, nothing changes, except the change of Planetary home, probably to a still very backward Planet, where each soul will have the necessary time to learn what it refused to learn here on Earth. An awakened consciousness, gradually, will understand the great innate power it carries. As all souls are fragments of the Divine Seed Atom, created in the Source like everything that exists in the infinite Universes, it has the power of co-creation. And now this power begins to manifest gradually. Each human being awakened to this higher consciousness will have a power never imagined before. Each one will be able to create according to what they understand and this power is unlimited. The miracles known and attributed to Christ Jesus are just a sample of the power that each higher consciousness can produce. He himself said in those times: You can do all this and much more. In addition to individual power, higher consciousness can immensely multiply collective power. It only takes a small group to unite in the same objective and it will manifest. This we will see soon, for we are still in the dawn of this awakening. But the first results can already be seen. When you change something in yourself, you will be changing that same thing in the Universe. This is a fact, for we are made of the same energy that created the worlds. How wonderful! Now we begin to truly know ourselves. Who we are, where we came from and where we will go. How much was hidden from us! But all of this was part of the learning in this school of souls. Your vibration will create the world you will inhabit. It can create a better World as well as a very difficult World to survive in. The choice is yours and that is what matters. A World of peace or a World of war. Remember that everything you see outside is an internal creation of yours. When you see the external scenario, remember that it is everything that is being created within you. And it will be your reality from now on. Illuminate your consciousness more! Allow yourself to see beyond the physical eyes. You will discover wonders that you did not know existed before. You will recognize powers you never imagined you had. And finally, YOU WILL KNOW THAT ALL POWER IS INDEED WITHIN YOU. Illuminate yourself! By illuminating yourself, you will be illuminating the entire Planet. Do not doubt this, for doubt is still the main obstacle that prevents your ascension. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Language of an Awakened Consciousness",
        texto: "Beloved ones! What wonderful times we are living! And, each day that passes, more and more we approach the end of a long cycle. This also shows us that a New Era is already outlined in the next steps. What a privilege to be able to be here at this moment and thus participate in the great event of the Planetary Transition! But it is necessary to consider that each soul currently incarnated has reached an individual degree of consciousness through successive reincarnations. And this makes a lot of difference in the way of understanding, acting, and finalizing the great journey of life of each human consciousness. The moment of awakening is already underway and will be finalized soon. As has been said here so many times, Earth is a School of Souls and, like any school, not all students achieve approval at the same time. Many souls ascended during Earth's trajectory through the worlds of Expiations and Trials. But it must be considered that the number is not significant. Awakening during the long dark night of the soul was almost a nightmare. Therefore, few succeeded. But now the great moment of intense Light begins to take shape. This will make all the difference. Light awakens! It is like the dawn of a new day, when all nature rejoices and sings to welcome the Sun. This long-awaited moment has arrived! Observe how nature sings! Observe the joy and color that now manifests! See with your own eyes! You do not even need someone to show you. But you need to have eyes to see! You need to have ears to hear! The one who has closed themselves to such a point as not to allow the Light to enter their room will certainly prefer the dimness to continue sleeping. They have no disposition to wake up and participate in the great event of Light! Awakening means illuminating yourself! Allowing the Light to enter, not only in your room, but to enter every cell of your body. The process is much broader than can be imagined. It is so deep that it will indeed change the consciousness of each awakened person. In fact, it has already changed a lot! And it is this change that is bothering those who do not wish to wake up. Those who open the windows to the Light are attacked by those who prefer to sleep longer. So, when they ask me: Am I awake?, I cannot know, but you know. See how many call you anything that is not indeed a compliment. They are bothered by your Light, for to them the darkness is more comfortable. An awakened consciousness will never go back to sleep. That is why the process is called ascension. It is the climb up the ladder of continued life. No one can stop an awakened consciousness, much less keep it under control. One more reason for the controllers of humanity to revolt against the process of ascension of the souls incarnated here. An awakened consciousness no longer speaks the same language as before. A new language is adopted. And those who sleep say this is a conspiracy theory. Yes, for them it is a conspiracy, for it hurts their interests. They also say they are witches. Yes, the magic of awakened consciousness enables infinite possibilities, something that the sleepers and the dominators do not understand. The language of an awakened consciousness bothers a lot. It promotes a different way of seeing life. And this is not a desire of those who command everything nor of the commanded who prefer the comfort of inertia. Leaving the comfort zone is an attitude that affronts the consciousness still trapped by the command of humanity's dominators. The language of an awakened consciousness is the opposite of that practiced by those who continue in deep sleep. The one who sleeps only dreams; the one who awakens lives reality. They can appreciate the Light that shines at every moment of the day. They can savor the beauty around them. They can touch everything that pleases their eyes, heart, and soul. The language of an awakened consciousness seems like a language not understood by the mass that sleeps in collective hypnosis. There are no longer subjects or arguments that can collaborate to wake up anyone. This language interests only those who have awakened, even for those who are still within four walls and have not gone out to appreciate the beauty of the Light. This language, although misunderstood by the hypnotized mass, is pleasant and interesting for those who have not yet encouraged themselves to enter the paths of ascension. But these feel the soft call that touches their heart. And, gradually, they leave their posts and also venture on this journey towards ascension. Nothing will be as before for those who have a broadened consciousness. Each step back is always an extra effort, for the path will lead forward in each lived situation. The awakened consciousness increasingly desires knowledge; to know. It can no longer remain in the inertia of before. It becomes restless and uncomfortable when it does not move forward. The language of an awakened consciousness is a practice used more and more and by an ever-increasing number of human beings. It is indeed a New Time! A New Era is upon us. Nothing will be as before! Regardless of the will of two thirds of humanity, now nothing and no one can stop what is to come. Nothing and no one can stop the Light that is coming. It is the force of the Universe following its dictates and its Natural Laws. The World will never be the same! You are no longer the same! The awakened consciousness will never be the same! Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! As the energies of Earth increase their frequency, everything that exists on the Planet follows the same rhythm. As we have said before, the process is independent of the will or not of the human race. All Kingdoms, whether animal, plant, or mineral, naturally accompany this change, for everything is energy. This energy comes from Light, which in turn originates from the Source, that is, from the Cosmic Central Sun. It is in the Source that everything is created, including the Divine Seed Atom, which is our True Self, or our HIGHER SELF. Our essence is the same as the Creator's, therefore we are also creators. We learned that God, the Creator, is an entity. This is not true. He is simply the SOURCE. He is the greater consciousness that emanates his seeds to create and populate Planets, Stars, Galaxies, and infinite Universes. I have already written here before about the Monads and how they subdivide into Spirit, Super Souls, Souls, and Soul Fractals. This fragmentation is necessary, for Third Dimension Planets do not have enough energy to be able to host our higher versions of ourselves. Remembering that everything is energy and, therefore, an entity with very high frequency cannot walk on 3D Earth, for it would annihilate everything around it wherever it passed. This is the reason and necessity for souls to divide into Fractals in order to experience life and creation in the lower worlds. Even being a tiny Fractal, the human of 3D Earth is a consciousness. This consciousness comes here to learn and grow gradually at the most distant point from the Source. The path is always the return home, that is, ascension. As this consciousness expands, it goes up in terms of frequency. When reaching higher frequencies, it becomes integrated into a higher version of itself and we call this ASCENSION. The next step for current humanity is to reach the minimum stable frequency of Fifth Dimension. Earth as a Planet already vibrates in 5D. Humanity is gradually rising as well. Many already reach bands of 5D and even 6D. Few manage to reach 7D frequencies. However, they remain only a few moments in these bands and then return to 4D frequencies and also the already known 3D, staying longer in it. The secret is to stay for longer and longer in minimum 5D bands. When this is achieved, the soul Fractal can consider itself ascended. With the greater incidence of Gamma Light that now reaches Earth, all consciousness can expand rapidly. It is a unique time, never lived on this Planet before. Such an opportunity will cause at least one third of Earth's current humanity to ascend to the Fifth Dimension definitively. Everyone who is incarnated now can ascend if they so wish. But an effort is needed that varies in degree according to the current stage of each consciousness. But this is what will decide the number of ready souls. The vast majority will make no effort, preferring to remain in the comfort zone. Ascending hurts. It is necessary to deconstruct the old human so that the New Human can rise from the ashes. Ascending is being reborn. It is the birth of the soul that passes through the 5D Portal and enters the New Earth. And, in this rebirth, birth is natural. It cannot be through cesarean section. The necessary effort must be made. Such rebirth does not happen in a day or even in a year. We have our entire current existence to do it. This is also the last incarnation within 3D duality. Upon disincarnating, the consciousness that is ready will return to the New Earth and will no longer have any risk of losing the opportunity to inherit the New Earth. Many have already come with the Soul Plan in this current incarnation without the need to disincarnate, and will make the ascension in physical bodies, for Earth will not be uninhabited at any time. Those who disincarnate without the frequency of the New Earth are taken to Worlds still of Third Dimension, according to the frequency of each consciousness. This is how the separation of the wheat from the chaff is made, prophesied by Christ Jesus himself. We are, therefore, in a unique moment, never lived on this Planet Earth. These are the times of the ascension of souls and the Planetary Transition. A lot of Light is arriving now and it is potentiating everything here. Including our psychic and mental powers of co-creation. The collective power is increasingly accentuated, being able to even hasten as well as delay the final time of definitive changes within this Transition. Do not underestimate your individual power, for it forms the collective of those who have the same thought. It was this collective power that determined the change of Earth's Timeline in 2010. A small portion of awakened human consciousness was enough to determine NO TO ARMAGEDDON. The more consciousness rises, the more power it has. Thus, you become a potential co-creator. Now you can create your own world. If your intention is a better World, that is the World you will have. However, if you believe the Planet will get worse and worse, it is to a worse Planet that you will go. This is nothing more than the Law of Attraction. You also need to understand that all your powers are being amplified in the same proportion as the expansion of your consciousness. Especially in relation to basic needs, such as healings for example. You can transform yourself into a potential healer. You can heal yourself. You can heal other people. You can heal animals and even plants. You can soften a storm. You can intercede on behalf of anyone. You can determine your future, your relationship, your profession, your destiny included. Do you really want a Fifth Dimension World or do you wish to remain in this one that is already well known? It only depends on the energy and frequency you create. YOU ARE THE CREATOR! YOU ARE THE HEALER! Learn to create! Learn to heal! The times have arrived. The time is now! Christ Jesus said in his time, when he performed the so-called miracles: You can do all this and much more! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Power of Intercession",
        texto: "Beloved ones! When we understand the power and support that was entrusted to us by the designs from above, life here in the physical Plane becomes much more pleasant. Everything that we understand as problems, difficulties, and uncomfortable situations are actually obstacles that teach us to become winners. Each soul in a physical body comes with a certain incarnation plan in order to evolve, experience, and take learning to its higher versions. Many times we say and even understand that a soul in its higher versions knows everything. This is not true. It has the potential to know everything and understand everything, but what it really needs is to experience each situation in lower worlds, for the higher worlds do not offer such opportunities. The consciousness of souls in higher worlds is very broadened and the perception also corresponds to the degree of predominant frequency there. But it is not a fertile field where souls can go through the hardest experiences as here on Earth, for example. This is the reason that enables elevated souls to send fractals to Third Dimension worlds. Those incarnated on Earth are fractals of souls that each form their Monad and, therefore, everyone has their HIGHER SELF. Experiencing duality is living the polarities within a 3D world. Each incarnated soul will go through the same lessons as the others; however, at different times. It is the most practical way that can facilitate their ascension. While one experiences a certain lesson, other souls have already gone through it, which creates an opportunity to provide assistance. Assistance can also be called charity or solidarity. When someone sees a human being going through tremendous difficulties, they can understand the situation better than the one going through it, since they have already gone through that lesson. Being in possession of the experience lived before, charitable help is possible. But before helping, it is necessary to exercise compassion. Understand that the lessons the other goes through are part of their learning. That they are what enable the frequency of broadening their consciousness. It is such experiences that shape the path of ascension. Always remembering that we are in a school of souls. It would be more tragic if everyone needed to go through the tests at the same time. Being on different steps of the ladder, those in front can always help those behind. Lack of knowledge causes most to intercede mistakenly on behalf of those going through trials. Almost invariably, one asks God to free the other from such trials. It would be the same as asking the school teacher to free the student from school tests. It would be more of a harm than a help, is it not? So, when you have the intention to help someone and this requires an intercession on their behalf, of course it is very useful. But the result is achieved only if done correctly. We have the guarantee that no HONEST REQUEST GOES UNANSWERED, ever! This Law is divine. The secret then is to make honest requests. It would not be honest to ask God to free the other from the trials that teach them and show them the path of their soul's evolution. However, when we understand that each one goes through exactly what they need to go through, we engage in solidarity and charity comes into play. We understand that they are fulfilling their own soul plan; that they were the trials requested to go through in this current existence; that they are the opportunities that now arrive to fulfill the learning they lack. Imbued with this compassion, we can intercede on their behalf. Not to ask that the trials be removed from them, but that they be granted divine support, that they may be inspired with the smoothest paths along the way and that they find the least painful ways during such learning. Always taking into account that everything the other goes through is indeed an opportunity to learn. Honest intercession always works. The more people do it in favor of the same person, the more it is potentiated. But it must be done in the way described here. As a suggestion, I would say a form that I usually use when I do it. RESPECTING THE SOUL PLAN OF..., I ASK THE DIVINE PROVIDENCE TO OFFER HIM OR HER THE NECESSARY SUPPORT AND THE POSSIBLE HEALING. EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT THESE ARE THEIR CHOSEN TRIALS, MAY THEIR PAINS BE SOFTENED WITHIN WHAT DIVINE PROVIDENCE ALLOWS. Involving the other in unconditional love; sending good energies; sending light; and other ways that may eventually be inspiring are also a very important contribution. And finally, remember that we are unlimited co-creators. All the good we do to the other will be the good we receive in return. The harvest always depends on the seed that is sown. We are much more than they made us believe. Trust the Plan, for God is in command! Namaste!",

        titulo: "Prepare to Remember Your Past Lives",
        texto: "Beloved ones! As the transition reaches its end, the consciousness of those who are ready for ascension will broaden to very high levels, to such a point that it will promote the remembrance of all past lives. Not only the lives experienced here on Planet Earth, but also outside of it. This preparation is requiring some efforts now, especially regarding the understanding that here we are in a school of souls. The experience in duality determines that one can indeed in each incarnation live sometimes as the good guy, sometimes as the bad guy. This alternation of status is what actually taught all the lessons to the students of this School. When consciousness reaches the highest levels, and this will not take long, each incarnated soul ready for its ascension will gradually remember each past life. It will remember that in each of them it lived a different character. In one life it was a murderer and in another it was murdered. In one it was a thief, in another it was robbed. It was rich on one occasion, in another it was miserable. It was wise in one existence and foolish in another. In short, everything about which one can have some notion was actually experienced at some point in the past. When we understand that there are no more lessons not yet experienced, we have the impression that this school will be part of the past. But it is not enough to just have experienced, it is necessary to have learned the lessons in their duality, that is, both in the condition of good guy and in the condition of bad guy. This is what is called duality, or polarities. Until recently, we learned that all evil practiced should one day be reversed, that is, suffer the same actions practiced before. Yes, this is true. But it is not a punishment as was imagined. In fact, not even a Karma to be redeemed, for if we are living the experiences that teach us what it is like to be in one or another condition, what really matters is the lesson learned. We can compare life in 3D to a great open-air Theater. All souls incarnated here live a different character in each incarnation. Nothing is real in 3D. That is why we say that everything is just an illusion. We will indeed know soon, as consciousness expands. If there is no mistake, but there is always learning, we begin to understand that even when in a past life we were the bad guy, it was indeed an experience of what it would be like to live a life as such. So, if I killed someone in a past life, I did not acquire a Karma as was previously understood. It was a lesson to learn what it is like to be a murderer. Obviously, after disincarnation, my soul recognizes the lived experience and then makes a soul plan to reincarnate and experience the other polarity, that is, to be murdered. Once both sides of the coin are experienced, the lesson is learned. Today, our consciousness can already understand this. There is no mistake, there is learning. However, after the experience, the consciousness already knows that killing someone is not necessary, for if it does, then yes it will be incurring the need for redemption, which is what we call negative Karma. Understanding clearly what the rules are in this School of Duality on a Third Dimension Planet will lessen the impact or shock that many will feel when the strongest events will quickly lift the veils. Remembering our actions practiced within what we understand as EVIL may not be pleasant at all for those who still do not understand that everything was an enactment so that the incarnated Soul Fractal could learn the lessons taught in this Terran School. Dreams are already bringing certain metaphors that refer us to such acts and actions of the past. But it is still not enough. It is necessary to become aware that the acts practiced when we were in the condition of bad guy are not real, that was indeed an enactment, for in 3D nothing is real. The first lesson is always new learning. Obviously, after this first time, the consciousness already knows that it should not repeat such acts, for then yes it will generate a Karma and the need for redemption. This is what happens today with a large portion of humanity. Even knowing that they should not practice certain acts, they are still practiced. Then come the consequences as we know them. A consciousness ready to ascend to 5D will remember its past. It will remember every detail and every lesson. It will understand that there were no mistakes, but there was always a lesson in each situation. There will be no regret or guilt. Instead, there will be in a certain way a certain pride in oneself, for it will appreciate the performance in each incarnation, even in those in which it played the role of a bad element. Before consciousness begins to remember all these details, it is necessary for each one to become aware of this. Otherwise, when all this information comes at once, many will go into shock, even for a certain time, enough to truly understand. When we say that consciousness is broadening, we are also referring to the fact that it will truly recognize who it is and also everything it experienced in past lives. It will also be a moment to prove the famous phrase: WE ARE ARCHITECTS OF OURSELVES. Finally, now we are rapidly approaching the conclusion of learning in this School of Souls. The end of a Cycle closes to give rise to a New Era. We will leave behind a World of Expiations and Trials to enter a World of Regeneration. The long-awaited Golden Age already announces its dawn. The already announced New Time finally begins to appear on the horizon. The moment is of jubilee and glory, for it is also the prize for those who have earned it. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Abundance and Prosperity",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The change will be total, for there is no comparison that can be understood with minds still in 3D. The important thing for now is that at least the incarnated souls trust and know that everything is coming for the better. The long-awaited time is finally arriving. We have said here before that this is the last incarnation of duality. Therefore, the one who disincarnates without the minimum frequency for the New 5D Earth will no longer reincarnate here. See the magnitude of the importance of this moment! This final opportunity cannot be wasted! With the change of Earth's Timeline in 2010, the Transition leaves behind the harder events classified as Armageddon and will go through a Transition as smooth as possible. This is the reason why most of humanity does not even realize what is really happening. The broader consciousness already perceives the movement and the incredible current changes. And they will continue until their conclusion, regardless of the number of incarnated who believe or not. Regardless of the number who make the movements together with the changes that occur. The resistance to following the flow of changes will only bring harm to those who resist. Nothing will affect the part of humanity that decides to make its ascension together with Gaia. This is a DECREE OF THE CREATOR. The reset of the Old Systems and the Reinitialization of the New Systems suitable for 5D Earth already started around 2016 and should be finalized within a few more years. Current indications show that they should not go beyond 2030, but I would particularly risk saying that they will be finalized a little earlier, perhaps by 2025 or 2026. But time does not matter, for what matters is that now everything is heading towards its apex. Nothing and no one can stop what is to come. And the apparent chaos that seems to be real is actually the rearrangement and the necessary adjustments for the changes underway. Among such changes, there is one that arouses great interest in most of humanity: the FINANCIAL SYSTEM. The experiences lived until now were hard in relation to abundance and scarcity. And this left deep traumas in each human consciousness. Fear and lack are memories that have not yet healed. But as we said before, now everything will end, for the time is of Transition. The old Financial System was appropriate to experience the polarities between abundance and scarcity. Those who learned will now live a New Era, that is, the Golden Age. The QFS (Quantum Financial System) is already in effect. It is gradually replacing the known Old System. Therefore, the majority who expect a great impact in this sector perceive nothing. The day will indeed come when it will be announced that nothing more of what was before will be valid. But there is no reason for concern, for the Quantum System knows everything about each human being. It has recorded everything since 1950. All financial transactions, licit and illicit businesses, all individual earnings and their origin, all thoughts of each one are now recorded. And this will determine what actually belongs or does not belong to each human being. In the final exchange of the Financial System, no one will keep what does not belong to them by fair right. And all those who worked and were exploited will take back what is rightfully theirs. Earth is a feminine consciousness; therefore, she is a mother. And, by this nature, no child of Gaia should suffer the lack of any means of dignified survival. And this will be the general rule soon. But it is necessary to understand that a mother does not offer something to her child that will harm them. The moment to receive a tool, an opportunity, a freedom or anything else, the mother knows and, therefore, would not risk giving something that could come to harm one of her children. ABUNDANCE is already available for those who are ready to make good use of it. It will be a gradual distribution according to and at the right time for each one. There will indeed be priorities, but nothing that is not always to bring benefits. The one who still does not know how to use a tool cannot have access to it, for they could run the risk of harming themselves. These will be criteria adopted from now on. The propitious frequency to receive abundance will indeed be based on the responsibility of each one, on the intentions of how each one will use and for what purposes such resources will be used. Also remembering that competition, the desire for power, exaggerated vanity, pride, and vices are 3D vibrations and will not have the frequency to align with abundance. However, cooperation will be an important key that will activate the new System. PROSPERITY will be a frequency aligned with abundance and will bring to good term all the initiatives of those who already vibrate in higher consciousness. Therefore, in the near future, all of Earth's humanity will be aligned and living in abundance and prosperity. For now, we already know that there is a lot going on. The New System is gradually taking over and replacing the Old System. Since this event will not happen in just one moment, but gradually, I suggest that each one make deep reflections of themselves starting today. See if you really deserve infinite abundance. What would you do with the unlimited resources that would eventually be offered to you. Your consciousness must be pure and free from any egoic interest. Free from individual ambitions. Unconditional love; plans that involve cooperation, the collectivity, care for nature, animals, land, and water also count as important; true solidarity, without personal interests; aid to humanitarian projects; the work of guidance, healing, and clarification; activities aimed at environmental recovery; in short, all thought that involves the collective as a whole, without preferences and distinctions, all of this will count in your favor so that you are among the priorities to receive the deserved abundance. But even if you do not fit into any of the above citations, do not be frustrated, for regardless of what you do or fail to do, in due time all the righteous will receive what is due to them. Do not ask me: do I deserve it? Ask your own consciousness. Only it can answer. Christ left a hint when he said: help yourself and I will help you. So, everything only depends on you. Earn it.

        texto: "Beloved ones! Everything that reaches us comes at the right moment and time. There is a cosmic intelligence that commands all movements in the infinite Universes. From a cloud in our atmosphere, to the movement of an entire Galaxy, there is a perfect command that permanently organizes and harmonizes. Or there would be no way for so many billions of Planets and Stars to follow their orbits without colliding with each other. We cannot admit that man is such a small being that he has no importance within the infinitude of divine creation. In fact, it has already been written in previous texts that a human body is a mini-universe. Our origin in the Source is a divine Seed Atom. We are therefore also atomic. But, above all, we are a consciousness. Even in this fractal that inhabits Planet Earth, with a very limited consciousness, we still have an importance so great that we cannot even imagine. We are here to help in the development not only of Planet Earth and its humanity, but also of the entire Galaxy. A human consciousness when it rises promotes a gradual and relative movement in this entire quadrant of the Universe. Many times we see someone saying they would like to change the World. Obviously, this World would be Planet Earth. Little does he know that this is not only possible, but it is much easier than one can imagine. The difference is that some understand that to change the world just change yourself. Others, however, wish to see the World changed, but do nothing for it. And it is here that we are going to clarify some important topics at this moment of Transition. You are not incarnated by chance at this moment. You have been preparing for long millennia in order to be here, now, being part of Earth's Transition and the ascension of part of humanity. You are here to make your own ascension. You will soon be an Ascended Master, just like all the previously ascended Masters. But you need to know this and, above all, believe! You are much more than you imagine yourself to be. If before you were indeed a fractal of your own consciousness, now this consciousness rises rapidly and new versions of yourself are taking over this material body. You become a new you every day. As your consciousness rises, the Universe delivers new packages of wisdom and new tasks to you. Observe how certain information until recently was not understood. Observe how now it has a meaning and is easily understood. And tomorrow you will be different from what you are today. Everything accelerates in the same proportion as Earth's Transition. But it must be remembered that no information will be delivered to you if you are not ready to understand it. The Universe does not waste time. It does not make mistakes. It never gets the address wrong. It knows exactly what your Soul Plan was for this current incarnation. Furthermore, there is a Quantum System that records every breath of every human being on Earth. How could there be an error in the delivery of packages with such existing technologies, outside of our knowledge until now? There is no possibility, for sure. But today's message wants to tell you to pay attention. The messengers of the New Era are distributing information and tasks to all those who are ready. Therefore, it is necessary to empty the old concepts and old beliefs that formed the consciousness of before. It is necessary to leave behind the old useless baggage from now on. Whoever is overloaded with such trinkets will not have room for the new packages, which will now be graciously distributed by the Laws that govern the Universes. No new information will be given to anyone unless they are ready to receive it, understand it, and know how to pass it on. False channelers will have serious difficulties maintaining their posts, for the broader consciousness will know how to discern the true from the illusory. The broader consciousness can no longer be deceived. The new information will only be understood by those who are ready to understand it. And this will be decisive, for those who are ready cannot wait for those who do not wish to promote the changes in themselves. The times have arrived! Observe the facts. Observe the information. Observe your capacity for understanding. And above all, observe the signs. The Era of Material Man ends here. We will now live a new time: the Era of Spiritual Man. All those who will make their ascension will understand that we are not just a body. They will understand that they are an expanding consciousness. A consciousness that is nothing more than a fractal of another larger consciousness and that, little by little, will integrate with its higher versions. We are returning home. Not a home in a certain place of the Universe, but our home within our own consciousness. We will understand more about this as we expand this fragmented consciousness, which animated this body of dense matter. We will very intensely and quickly become aware of who we really are. The veils are lifting. A new scenario will emerge and will finally show the long-awaited New Earth! But we must not forget this detail: nothing will reach anyone unless they have a minimum of consciousness to understand the messages that are sent to them, for the Universal Laws are perfect and do not waste any word, any package. They simply never get the address wrong. Be fit! Be attentive! Keep your address updated. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Therapies with Quantum Energy",
        texto: "Beloved ones. The work of clarification is my earthly mission for this current incarnation. I have emphasized this over these years, to which I dedicate myself to passing on information that can help not only in healing the ailments of the body, but mainly in healing the ailments of the soul. Understanding is the first step to healing, for it invariably comes from inside out. The heal yourself has always been valid and will continue until the end of the Planetary Transition. However, we are now in a unique moment within this Transition. It is the time of cleansing our ancestry, that is, of cleaning out our basements. This cleansing needs to be done, for it will free us from the TRAUMAS that we still carry even unconsciously. Such traumas and also the limiting beliefs that were imposed over the millennia are still the greatest obstacle that prevents the well-being that everyone seeks. My mission is clarification and, therefore, there is no way to use certain techniques that would require a lot of preparation time, as is the case with Quantum Healing techniques. Thus, I recommend that you each seek the paths that can hasten the healings, especially when knowledge alone is not enough. Remembering that knowledge is item number one of ascension and healing of all ailments. However, knowledge is not enough when there are traumas imprinted in the soul's memories. Traumas are the consequences of the pains and sufferings that each one lived in the past, whether in this or in previous existences. There are many holistic techniques that are fundamental in these healings, but nothing compares to those that use Quantum Physics. I wrote in the last text of 2021 that the year 2022 would be the marker of a time. And that it would also be the year of holistic therapists, especially those who use quantum healing. Many ask me for indications of techniques, as they feel they need to seek them for their healings. I learned that there is a force above us that leads each one to the paths that are necessary for them. And, therefore, it is not the therapist who goes to you, but it is you who goes to the therapist, for time is increasingly short. Each technique, even if practiced by many therapists, is never exactly the same in its results, for, among other characteristics, there is the way of conducting and using the energy moved during the therapy. And in quantum therapies this is fundamental. Knowing the technique, but not knowing the therapist, there is always doubt in indicating or not when we are asked to give an opinion. But today I will suggest here for you who have already asked me for therapy suggestions or even for those who have not asked, for I know how many traumas there still are within each one. Many already know the work of Dinara Schio. And for those who do not know, I inform here that we worked together for 8 years. We have a side by side journey during that time and learned a lot from each other, but, above all, we know the result of each technique employed and its benefits. Therefore, I can endorse her work. The Quantum Healing Journey that she uses, in addition to her own knowledge, is filled with important details that were passed to her by the Spiritual Team that supports her. The results are always very positive. And when someone asks me for help regarding their difficulties, besides clarification, there is not much to do. So, here I leave in a generalized way that you take advantage now of the Fourth Quantum Healing Journey that Dinara will do. Registrations began on May 5th and will go until May 26th. The technique will be put into practice for 21 consecutive days. It is not necessary for the registrant to take time to receive the healing benefits. The registration data is enough, for as we know, the technique is Quantum. No one is obligated to participate or to do therapies. Each one does when they feel the call or the need. Therefore, it is unnecessary to complain about charging or not, for the healing journey is an option for each one to participate or not. All fair work should be remunerated. Whoever does not agree, does not do it and period. Or else I suggest that you take courses and specialize in quantum healing, and then you can self-apply without any cost. For those who feel they still need to free themselves from something that bothers them, the Quantum Healing Journey is an opportunity. Enjoy! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Collapse of 3D",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Planet Earth no longer vibrates in Third Dimension. The minimum frequency range is in 4D, but it will not stay in this vibration for long either. It is already possible to feel the activations of 5D, 6D, and 7D. Remembering that, at the moment when the minimum base is Fifth Dimension, we will have five vibrational ranges on our Planet, that is, frequencies between 5D and 9D. This will be the energy of the New Earth. This year of 2022 will be a marker year, for we leave behind the Third Dimension. Many now feel this variation of energies. The strange symptoms that most experience in their bodies, both physical and emotional, are a characteristic of this change. We do not know when 4D will also be left behind definitively, but it should not take long. Some references tell us that there are six stages and now we are completing the third. Let us hope, therefore, that after this current year the world we know energetically will no longer be the same. But it is necessary to understand that the vibration of the Planet and its kingdoms makes this transition naturally, regardless of humanity. Gaia's consciousness predominates over the Planet itself, mainly over the mineral, plant, and animal Kingdoms; however, the hominal has its own consciousness, for it belongs to a different soul classification. Endowed with their free will, they possess the soul, a freedom of individual choices within this Terran school. This is the reason that makes all the difference within a Planetary Transition. Due to this individuality of consciousness, while the Planet and its Kingdoms no longer vibrate in 3D, most of humanity is still trapped in the old vibration. And this is causing what is called the collapse of 3D. There is no way for something to continue for long vibrating at a frequency that has ceased to exist. As everything is energy, this something will cease to be supplied and, gradually, disappears, for it dissolves naturally. This is how the evolution of worlds is understood. In the infinite Universe, everything is constant movement. When something becomes stagnant for too long, it collapses. So, if the Third Dimension frequency no longer exists on this Planet, it is a matter of time until the adjustments are finalized. Let us not confuse here the consciousness of each human being who will pass to the Fifth Dimension with Gaia's consciousness. Gaia is the consciousness of the Planet. She will be in the higher bands anyway, regardless of whether humans rise or not. It is getting easier to understand the separation of the wheat from the chaff, is it not? Remember that it has been written here many times: each one will be where they should be. Everything is frequency and no one can be out of it. Attraction, as well as repulsion, occurs through this tuning. The one who also vibrates magnetically in the same wave range will remain on 5D Earth. The one who does not reach such bands will be expelled from the Planet. The collapse of 3D will promote total changes in all Systems known until now. This change is called GESARA. Keep this word well, for it will be increasingly in evidence from now on. But it is necessary to understand that GESARA is the total change of all Systems, and not just the Financial System as most believe. Within GESARA there is also the QFS which, this one yes, will deal with the financial itself. When talking about changes, many feel a chill down their spine. Man has by nature an aversion to changes. But now there is no other alternative. Either change, or you will have serious difficulties that will be increasingly unbearable. But the change is not only in daily life, it is much more a CHANGE OF CONSCIOUSNESS. Do today what needs to be done today, but have this awareness that everything is changing. And when someone puts resistance to such changes, they will inevitably be on a collision course with the frequencies of the New Earth. Do not resist! Get into the flow and ride the crest of the wave that now rocks the Planet! Get into the swing of the higher energies and feel how rewarding it is to be part of the Planetary Transition! Do not keep feeding what will cease to exist. Do not vibrate in fear or any other inferior emotion. Remember that everything follows the Divine Plan and, for this reason, God is in command. But, above all, know that the collapse of 3D was inevitable and so it will also be with 4D. The times have arrived and a New Era is already being felt, even if the eyes still cannot see. Namaste!",

        titulo: "And When Everything Stops?",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The exchange of Systems has been occurring for some time. Even though many do not even realize it, the Transition of a time is happening at an accelerated pace. Every day, more and more Gamma Light pulses reach Earth, and this new higher frequency energy promotes the change of everything on this Planet. The origin of everything that is known in the Universe has its starting point in Light. The Cosmos (OMniverse) has its Central Sun which is the Source and the wellspring of Creation. It divides into Multiverses, which also each have their Central Sun. Each Multiverse further divides into Universes that also each have their Central Sun. Universes divide into Galaxies and each one also has its Central Sun, which Science calls a Black Hole. And within each Galaxy there are Solar Systems, like our Sun, for example, which, in turn, has Planets and their Moons. So, the Light you receive every day through our Sun is not only its own light, but is a mirroring of all the other Suns superior to it. Since 2012, our Sun has begun to receive a greater flow of Gamma Light from the others. In fact, the one who controls the dose of this flow is the Galactic Central Sun. It has the function of coordinating the frequency of each Star and Planet that are part of the Milky Way. As written here in previous texts, our Solar System entered an octave in the Galactic spiral in 2012. This repositioning provides the incidence of a greater factor of luminosity. And this is the reason for Earth to also receive more Gamma Light now. It will be this Light that will promote Earth's Planetary Transition. With the increase in Light frequency, everything here needs to adapt. The energies of minerals will have a higher frequency. Plants and animals follow the same change. And hominids cannot be different. Frequency is a natural state that organizes the harmonious functioning between the set of everything that exists on a Planet. Therefore, when we say that there will be a reset of the Old Systems, we are saying that nothing more of what was before will be within a short time. Even though Earth's Transition takes around three centuries to be completed, we are now in its final moments and, because of this, all Systems need to change frequency. When we do a renovation in a house, the most beautiful part is always seen at its end. The painting and color of it begin to appear. The arrangement of its pieces and furniture takes shape and order finally appears. Only after this entire process can its residents enjoy the new house. Our Planet is our home. It is the home of this great family of souls that incarnated on Earth. Those who proposed to collaborate with the renovation will inhabit the new planetary home. Those who did not agree with the changes should look for a house that still maintains its previous characteristics. They are not ready for the changes. The Creator unconditionally respects the will of each one, indiscriminately. But let us now talk about the necessary Reset. In 2010, Earth's Timeline was changed. Due to the will and purpose of a significant portion of Earth's humanity, the Galactic Council decided, at the request of Gaia's consciousness, for a smoother and more peaceful Transition. I have also written here before that the Armageddon Line was discarded. There is no reason to fear great disasters, including some that could even destroy the Planet. This new Timeline will determine the Planetary Transition in its final phase. We are in the last years within the predicted three centuries. It is time to prepare for the exchanges of current systems. Even though most can be exchanged gradually, that is, without interrupting their operation, in some sectors this is not possible. Therefore, there may be momentary interruptions. Once the exchange is made, such systems return, already within the new configurations. Even being only part of the current systems, it is very likely that they are exactly the most important ones, such as communications, for example. We know that they belong to the arm of humanity's controllers. This tentacle has always manipulated everything and everyone. And it will be the last bastion and the last resistance of the cold-blooded Octopus. There will be resistance on its part, but it will be in vain. Nothing and no one can stop the Planetary Transition. There is no reason for anyone to be worried when EVERYTHING STOPS. This possibility is very real, for it is precisely because of the resistance of the controllers to yield to the changes. So, a New communications System will have to be implemented. But, for this, the Old System needs to stop working. This is the announced reset. And when everything stops, just trust! No one will be left helpless. It will only be a few days, enough time for the exchange. There may be no type of communication. No financial transaction either, for in system, nothing works. No TV, no radio, no cell phone, no internet. But basic services should not be paralyzed. If there is any interruption, stay calm and everything returns naturally afterwards. And when everything stops, just know that the exchange is indeed being made. And then everything will return better. We will have clean and free energy. Free internet. New healing modalities for all ailments. New financial systems. New communications. New education systems will be implemented immediately. New government systems. And the list is endless. Beloved ones! We are in the anteroom of the great Amphitheater of life. The great long-awaited show is finally about to begin. It may take a few days, a few months, or even a few years, but it is ready to be shown. This current incarnation is the most important of all our passages through Earth. We came to be part of this show. We have been long prepared for such an event. Now let us not lose our place in the bleachers. After the system exchange, nothing will be as before. Then we will indeed have the Great Event. The festival of Lights and Colors will come to announce the beginning of a New Era. After this Event, we will have an impressive turn in our consciousness. It will broaden to such a point that we will no longer recognize ourselves, for what was before will seem like just an enactment. We will laugh at our fears and the difficulties that have tormented us so much until now. We will finally have contact with our Brothers and our Galactic Families. Only then will we realize that our consciousness will finally be within the Fifth Dimension. We will know our true history. Also the history of Earth and the Stars. There will be no more veils covering consciousness, it will not be limited only to Earth, but will naturally navigate outside the Solar System as well. The times have arrived! And when everything stops, just know that it will not be the end, but the beginning of a New Time! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Last Lesson in the Old 3D",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Those who have passed in this School of Souls in the Third Dimension are about to make their ascension to higher Dimensions. Time is hurrying, for a New Earth appears on the horizon line. A long Cycle of Trials and Expiations is being finalized. The Great Master Sananda, incarnated as Jesus of Nazareth two thousand years ago, left us a legacy and a certainty: a New Earth will emerge. This New Earth will be part of the higher Worlds and there will be no more pain or suffering. At the closing of the Old Cycle, there will be two destinations for humanity: the meek and pure of heart will inherit the New Earth. Those who did not reach the necessary frequency for such will have to leave it, for their consciousness has not yet understood all the lessons made available here. This is the understanding of the metaphor of the separation of the wheat from the chaff. In recent weeks, we have been receiving much guidance about this end of a time. Among them, today I will try to pass on to you who follow me the one that caught my attention the most. I gave it a title so that the text can be developed, but I could have given any other definition. I will interpret it as THE LAST LESSON OF THE OLD 3D. I do not know how it is today in the schools you or your children study. But in my student days, even those who had already learned the lessons went through a series of tests at the end of the school year, in order to prove that they were qualified to climb a step on the ladder of learning. Finally, the tests tested the student's capacity and served to verify if they could ascend to the next level. Nothing is different in a School of Souls, as Earth has been until now. The Cycle of limited consciousness of the Third Dimension closes and nothing more will be limited as before, for in 5D and above consciousness will be broadly expanded. So much so that a 3D mind cannot even imagine the capacity of a 5D consciousness. There will indeed be a certain moment, or even several events, that will lift the veils definitively and, then, a new consciential panorama will emerge. It will indeed be the moment when our soul version will integrate with its higher version. This integration will unite the learning of the 3D fractal with a fractal of Dimensions above. The union of these consciousness will add up to such a point that they will merge into one; however, at a frequency compatible with the Dimensions of 5D to 9D. The part of humanity that is entering this 5D frequency needs to pass the last test. It really needs to leave behind the 3D vibrations that are still within each consciousness. It is not just a detail, but a sum of packages that are part of the soul's baggage. I have already written in previous texts that these packages are emotions, beliefs, and habits of the Old 3D Earth. Fear, anger, and guilt are undoubtedly the heaviest. This ancestry needs to be healed. Such energies are obstacles that compromise the passage through the 5D Portal. But there are others that may still resonate within each incarnated person. And it is exactly there that we will be tested, as the title of this text says. Let us go to the didactics and then put it into practice. All of us who are in this Terran School have the unconditional support of the Ascended Masters and also of the Brothers of the Higher Spheres among the higher Dimensions. Do such Supporters care about the different stages of each incarnated soul? Do they make a distinction between a more elevated being and a less elevated one? Do they pit humans against each other, for the differences and divergences of anything that may exist here, as we can indeed see today among humans? The us against them quite evident today, do the selfless supporters practice it in relation to the incarnated? So, if our supporters do not care about our differences, and also do not fail to assist even those who are notoriously already failed in this ascension, it is necessary to take into account that all those who will make the ascension now will also become Ascended Masters. By climbing this step, they will also be able to support souls who are learning in other Worlds of Expiations and Trials, including the part of humanity that will be taken to such worlds. This makes it easier to understand and deduce that if you do not accept the limitations of the other now, how can you be an Ascended Master tomorrow? Of course, consciousness is still preparing for this, but it needs to be put into practice as soon as possible, for this vibration, if it remains in consciousness, may even prevent your own ascension. It is not necessary to condone what others do and that, in our view, is not correct. This would be co-authorship of a crime, for example. But we can look compassionately, for his step on the ladder is still down there and we already passed it a long time ago. When we see that the other is mistaken, we must understand that they have not yet gone through such lessons. However, the day will come when they too will be at the door of ascension, even if this takes thousands or millions of years. Understanding, accepting, having compassion for the delay of the other and, above all, not judging, not offending and not exposing their limitations is always a path. It has already been mentioned here that each one is co-creating their reality, for they still need it. We cannot demand that everyone be at the same consciousness, that is, at the same understanding as us. Can you imagine if the Ascended Masters demanded this of us? Respect, compassion, and unconditional love are the tripod that catapults ready souls to 5D. Compassion is what I described here. Respect is not interfering in the lessons that the other still needs to learn. Only guide them when they themselves ask for help. Then comes solidarity and charity. Understanding that they need to go through the lessons they still lack is exercising sincere respect. Also understand that no one goes through what they do not need to go through. So, when a family member or even a person from our midst goes through a difficult trial, do not revolt. On the contrary, understand that there is an opportunity to exercise the learning so far. Remember that we are in the final tests. Seeing the drama without being part of it is a good alternative too. Respect is not restricted only to humans, but to everything on Earth. Animals, plants, and all other resources of Earth are energies from the same Source from which we came. The harmony between all Kingdoms and between everything there is, is also the understanding that we are all ONE. When I mistreat anything, I will be hurting myself. When I pollute nature, I will be polluting my own soul. That is why we are co-creators of our reality. Understanding the differences, the situations, the difficulties, the challenges, our pains and those of others; knowing that for someone to have a privilege it is necessary to take that something from another; when someone gets a lot, others get little or nothing; desiring privileges, power beyond what is necessary, satisfying the ego at any price, destroying or damaging someone else's property, public property, or any other asset that is useful to anyone is a certificate of failure for 5D. Unnecessary attachment is a sign that there is still a lot of fear within yourself and the time demands that it be released, for we are approaching the great planetary change. We are on the last steps of the old 3D. One last effort is still necessary, but this effort is not beyond the capacity and limit of each one. If you have come this far, you can! Trust! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The More Dirt Appears, The Greater the Cleaning",
        texto: "Beloved ones! It is impressive how everything is being illuminated! Those dark basements that kept all the debris accumulated over long millennia of darkness now receive, each day, more infusion of Gamma Light and everything becomes exposed. The consciousnesses asleep under the thick veils of forgetfulness made incarnated humanity easy prey for the dominators who arrived here with the coming of the Archons, fugitives from the Galactic Wars of Orion. By taking Terran humanity hostage, the difficulties that affect Third Dimension Worlds became even harder. We know that the Fallen Angels are also children of the Creative Source, like everything that exists in the infinite Multiverses. This is the reason why the Creator Father God had compassion and allowed a long time in order to offer the rehabilitation of the lost sheep. The parable of the prodigal son shows us how great is this father/mother love, which is always ready to accept the return of everyone home. This return must always be spontaneous, never obligatory. There is always time! And there was much time here on this Planet Earth as well. It is estimated that there were around 350 thousand years of waiting for the redemption of those who fell into disgrace before the Moral and Dignified Laws that govern the Cosmos. But there are always limits, for the entire OMniverse is in constant movement and evolution. Earth could not be different. Upon reaching the twilight of a long Cycle navigating in seas of Third Dimension Light, now our Planet is entering an octave in the galactic spiral. This provides the entry of new energies and much more Gamma Light, which makes Earth transform into a Super Nova. Such condition provides a broad cleansing of all the energies that were characteristic of Third Dimension frequencies. Nothing will be as before anymore! They are Natural Laws that govern the worlds, that determine the frequencies and the destiny of Earth from now on. No force, however great it may be, can prevent what is to come. The Creator said Enough! His children who do not wish to return to the Father's house will have other opportunities, but no longer here on Earth. There will be planetary homes of all frequency variations that match the vibrations of each one. And there will also be a recycling of fallen souls that will no longer have any condition for rehabilitation, except to go through the cleansing of their memories through the sanitizing fire of the Cosmic Central Sun. This Sun is the Creative Source itself, where everything begins. It is there that the Divine Sparks begin their journey and then divide into Super Souls, Souls, and Soul Fractals in order to populate, create, and develop the infinite Worlds. Many will have to start again as Sparks, for, by their free will, they so decided. All possibilities are exhausted for those who made their choices in this way. So, now everything is being defined. The Galactic Christ became Planetary two thousand years ago, incarnating as Jesus of Nazareth. His mission was to alert humanity that a Cycle was about to close. He himself said: Soon, a long Cycle will close and a New Earth will emerge. A World where there will be no more pain or suffering. The meek and pure of heart will inherit the New Earth. This time has come! The Change is happening before our eyes. We can see the dust from the demolition of the old planetary house. All the dirt that shows is the result of this Transition. The more dirt, does not mean that everything is getting worse, but rather that everything is being reformulated. The worst is over! But it is necessary to trust! To understand that no change is easy, but that it is necessary. Soon we will be in a new house and then we will be able to recognize that all the effort was not in vain. There is a divine plan under construction now. Trust! If evil is appearing without circumlocution, it is the sign that it has stripped itself to show who really takes pleasure in it. They are the revelations also announced by Christ Jesus. Hold on tight now, for the Ship is going to rock! But always trust, for God is in command! Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! There are no limitations for an expanded consciousness. This statement begins to make sense now, as humanity is leaving the vibrations of a Third Dimension World. The experience on 3D Earth was precisely to live the sensation of being separated from the Source. That is why the soul comes only in the form of a Fractal, that is, a fraction of its own higher consciousness. A good part of Earth's humanity has already made its collection of learning within the polarities of Third Dimension. So the time has come for the return home. The previously limited and fragmented consciousness will now be integrated into a higher version of itself. In this integration, it goes through a rapid change, enough to recognize that it is no longer the same as before. Consciousness is not the physical body. Consciousness is energy from the Source. It is part of the Higher Self, of the Divine Seed Atom, of what we call Spirit. I have already written here in previous texts about this, and how the Spirit divides into Super Souls and Souls and their Fractals. CONSCIOUSNESS IS LIGHT! The Source is Light! God is Light! Everything is Light. As energy, only Light exists. So, if this is so, we can understand that where there is Light, there is the result of the creation of something. And where there is no Light, this creation does not yet exist. Even what is known as evil, or shadow, is a prototype of something that is being built and has not yet received enough Light, or even by the absence of Light. As Light reaches a minimum necessary frequency, then a new creation emerges. This is how everything is created in these infinite Universes. In the beginning, everything was shadow. Then Light was made. This is how many theories try to explain the origin of worlds. Even so, minds are not yet ready to understand the grandeur of the whole. But at least we are in a time of broadening consciousness and we can climb a few steps on the ladder of knowledge. So everything is Light. Light is the Source. Everything emanates from the Source! You are this Light. So you are also the Source. Everything that is there in the Source can manifest in you. And everything that you create here in the lower Dimensions you send as part of this consciousness that integrates with the whole of the ONE. Yes, it seems complex, but it is not. Everything is logic. And everyone understands logic. And today we will take another step towards the Source. Gradually, the sensation of disconnection is diluting and we feel more connected to our cosmic origin. We truly feel that we are on the way back home. So, if consciousness is Light and we are a consciousness, you are Light. All problems, pains, suffering, scarcity, in short, all situations that bring discomfort are nothing more than the absence of Light. The reflection of this lack is felt as discomfort in our dense bodies, for otherwise we would not understand that there is a point that needs to be illuminated. Disease is the absence of Light. Hunger is the absence of Light. Misery, crime, theft, abuse, fear, in short, the list is enormous, but all situations of suffering are nothing more than the absence of Light. The need of the incarnated soul to illuminate all of this makes it have a fragile body that feels all the symptoms where there is the absence of this Light. And now let us get to the main point of today's topic. You can do much more than you imagine. So, the time has come to free yourself from the beliefs that limit you so much. There is a mini Source inside you. Learn to use it. When someone tells you: Do not look outside, look inside, this is a great truth. There is nothing out there that can do more than what is already in this internal Source. There is enough for everything and everyone in there. And, if so, you lack nothing. ILLUMINATE YOURSELF! Breathe this Light. Spread this Light to all the cells of your body, around you and in all directions. Supply yourself with this Light always, for it is not limited. Send it to animals, to plants, to rivers, to seas, in short, to wherever you feel you should send it. Send it to regions where there are conflicts. Send it to authorities who still take pleasure in the absence of Light. When people ask me for guidance on how to help people or family members who need help but do not accept it, I simply say: SEND LIGHT! Nothing is more powerful than sending Light. Love is pure Light. Where there is Light, there is abundance of everything, for I already said here at the beginning of the text that Light is the creative Source itself of everything there is. Pain is a form of expression of something that is transforming into Light. It is still in pre-birth, but soon something new and illuminated will be revealed that will no longer feel pain. When a child is born, it is said that the mother gave birth (in Portuguese: deu a Luz, literally gave the Light). Yes, it is Light that brings a new life, not a new life that brings Light. What beautiful times we are living! We have the power to illuminate anything that can be imagined. From a pain or illness that someone is feeling or going through, to any emotion of discomfort that is worrying other people. Send Light to such people and just trust! Remember that you can create, but you cannot interfere in the Soul Plan of others. The Light that you send is a tool that the other will have and, thus, can use it or not, according to their own decision. Do not want to change the other. Just send Light and wish the best! Do not judge the other. Just send Light and intend that this will help them find the way. Do not lament for the other, send Light. Never wish evil on someone, send Light! Do not implore to the Heavens with desperation wanting to help someone, just send Light with love and confidence. Healing is nothing more than Light being made. The true healer has no supernatural power, but has a great power to channel Light towards the one who needs healing. Techniques help, but what really heals is the Light that the healer manages to send. Christ did this with just a simple intention. And He said that all of us can do this and much more. So, what do you still need to put your innate powers into practice? There are no more excuses for someone to say they do not know what to do, or how to help someone. Start here. You can do much more than you imagine! Namaste!",

        titulo: "There Is No Mistake in Reincarnations",
        texto: "Beloved ones! It is common to hear wise people say that winners look for solutions when facing a difficult situation, while the unsuccessful always look for an excuse. It is these two choices that make a difference in the final result of the same situation. The opportunity is identical for both, but the choices are what bring the positive result or not for everyone. All souls currently incarnated on Earth are Fractals of higher versions of themselves. They decided to experience duality under the veil of forgetfulness. No one was forced to go through such experiences. Therefore, nothing justifies the lamentations and failure in the necessary learning. To say that the forces of non-Light are responsible for the delay in the conclusion and finalization of this Cycle in the Third Dimension is to try to hide the sun with a sieve. Delegating responsibilities to others is justifying failure and trying to hide one's own incompetence. Earth is a School Planet and provided the same opportunities to each of its students. Each soul that decided to incarnate here knew all the rules and the entire curriculum of this School. It knew that while incarnated, it should learn all the experiences within duality. It knew that the necessary time depended only on itself. It knew that nothing and no one could hinder its performance, unless it consented to it. It knew of the difficulties, but above all knew that only it would depend on the advance or delay in the conclusion of this journey through a World of Expiations and Trials. Now the time has come for the finalization of this long marathon in 3D. It is the last incarnation and the last experience in Duality. A great wave of ascension is expected and, as we have said here before, around one third of incarnated humanity will ascend to a World of Regeneration. This will also be the great moment for Planet Earth, which will make the Transition to Fifth Dimension frequencies. So, if nothing and no one can prevent someone from making their ascension, why are there still people who take pleasure in evil? It is not easy to accept that a soul still remains on the path of non-Light, when it could simply end the experiences in duality. However, they decide to continue for a few more millennia on the long journey of ascension. In their soul plan, they prefer to deepen the experiences further, for they do not yet feel sufficiently prepared to integrate with their higher versions. Those people who take pleasure in evil, or who still wish to face life situations among thieves, among abuses, and especially among unscrupulous dominators, are actually not mistaken. They are needing more experiences and, therefore, fight and defend their banner, even if, in the eyes of many, they are completely disoriented. We do not know the needs of the soul of others. In fact, we can barely understand our own needs. If a part of incarnated humanity still needs more lessons, this is a purpose of each soul. And, in this way, it is not up to us to judge. I do not know and you also do not know what the purpose of the other's soul is. But it knows about itself. Even with the veil of forgetfulness, it knows in its Inner Self and ends up acting within this need. We should not judge others from our own view of things. If the Creator Himself gives this freedom, we who are mere supporting actors of the great work should only do what concerns us. I would say that achieving ascension now is the only thing that really interests us. Otherwise, the successive incarnations up to here will have been worthless. Respect the will of the other. Only they know what they still need to complete their course in this School of Souls. Of course, many times we feel the desire to help, but how to help, if they themselves decided what is best for them? There is a force within each one that makes them decide for the continuity or finalization of this learning within a World of Expiations and Trials. We have reached the end of a time, long awaited and anxiously anticipated. I know what is best for my soul, even still under the veil of forgetfulness. The voice of this soul echoes through the heart. I have decided to finalize this long journey, for there is nothing more to learn in duality. I can make such choices, for I am ready... I feel ready. And you can do it too. But do not want the other to decide through you. Only they know what they still need. There is no integration of the Soul Fractal with its higher version while the frequency is not aligned with its Higher Self. There cannot be a rupture of frequency. There must indeed be adjustment in this frequency and, then yes, the ascension will finally be happening. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Sacred Symbols",
        texto: "Beloved ones! When a soul decides to experience life in a Third Dimension World, it knows beforehand that it will live most of the time as if it were really disconnected from the Source. Subjected to the veil of forgetfulness, it will no longer remember who it is. Nor will it know that there are many versions of itself in other versions of its soul, higher ones. In short, it will truly feel lost in the dark night of the soul. But the Creator has a perfect Plan for each of His creatures. Everything is thought out in its smallest details. And a soul incarnated in Third Dimension is never alone. Even if it cannot see, support is never lacking. There are, however, some things that help in a certain way to bring some comfort to these afflicted souls. Among them, we can mention here the Sacred Symbols. They are the ones that offer some comfort and at least a thread of hope in the most difficult moments, in this long journey in 3D. Sacred Symbols favor the connection with the Creator. They function as a thread that still connects the soul to the Source. Throughout time, those who were initiated in the School of Mysteries learned to decipher and use such symbols. On the other hand, those who align themselves in the frequency of Shadows have always had true disgust for these Symbols. A Sacred Symbol dazzles the eyes and consciousness of those who prefer non-Light. This is the reason that led this Caste, over the millennia, to try to destroy this symbology. A Sacred Symbol functions as a YANTRA. It has the same capacity as Mantras. The only difference is that the Mantra uses sound and the Yantra uses an image. However, both connect the soul to higher divinities, to the Creator, to the Source, in short, to the higher versions of our own Self. This is what the Darkness fears most. They know that the moment human consciousness expands more, Sacred Symbols can easily be interpreted by any incarnated being. This interpretation will favor a closer connection with the Divine and with the Higher Dimensions. Finally, they can hasten the ascension of Earth's souls. Sacred Symbols have always existed and are very numerous, so they have always been available to assist humanity. We will not talk about them today, for the text will refer only to one Sacred Symbol, perhaps because of the important moment that Earth is going through. And also because of certain events that became public in recent weeks. Let us talk about the Flag of Brazil. First, let us say that all national flags are Sacred Symbols. Even a flag that represents any organization or association, for it is in the Flag that represents them that energy is concentrated. How many times have we seen groups trying to destroy the adversary's flag. Yes, it is a method widely used by Darkness, for they do not see much beyond like the Light. They only see the immediate obstacle, and the flag can mean this obstacle. As concentrated energy, they only feel it. And the instinct to attack is immediate. Brazil has a sacred predestination within the Divine Plan for Earth. As stated at the beginning of the text, all those who have already had access to the School of Mysteries, not necessarily in this current incarnation, but in some incarnation here on this Planet, understand or will understand at the opportune moment how sacred symbology will guide their steps. The incarnated souls who possess such knowledge will have the mission of guiding the rest of humanity in this final stretch of the Planetary Transition. They will be the champions of the Apocalypse (remember that Apocalypse means change and revelations). Sacred Symbols are obstacles for those of non-Light to maintain their Plan of domination. So, there is an energetic and spiritual War happening. Even invisible to physical eyes, it is unfolding under our feet. It will intensify even more and we will be able to see the fall of many Symbols. Yes, including the Symbols that Darkness has always used. We will see the fall of great satanic brands. We will see the malignant Yantras being overthrown one by one. We will see the definitive fall of the Deep State, but first we will have the revelations of each thing and its meaning. We will indeed see the collapse of the 3D Matrix. And in this energetic War, it is natural that those of non-Light try to attack Sacred Symbols. And if Brazil is the Heart Chakra of the Earth, that is, the heart of the World, it is natural that its main Sacred Symbol, its Yantra, its National Flag is vilely attacked. We will not enter into the merits of the discussions here. The theme here has the purpose of clarifying, for everyone needs to know the hidden truths. Nothing more will remain hidden. Everything will be revealed. And many are revealing themselves too, for the chaff and the wheat have already been separated. It only remains for the awakened ones to exercise compassion in relation to those who must leave this beautiful Planet that will definitely be the Garden of Eden. All the Christic energy of the Heart Chakra of the Planet is represented in the National Flag of Brazil. That incarnated soul that designed it, exactly in the format and colors that compose it, was by inspiration from Above. And what is represented in this Sacred Symbol is the cause of so much fury on the part of those who take pleasure in and sympathize with Darkness. Nothing will stop what is to come. The desperation of non-Light is exactly because of this. The Light will definitively dissipate the shadows of Planet Earth. Everything will change. And like a human heart, Brazil will irrigate the necessary energy to the rest of the planetary body for its complete change. FROM BRAZIL TO THE WORLD. Everything will begin here. The heart will never stop beating, for the Planet would not survive. Earth's Timeline was changed in 2010. Armageddon will not happen and this is the reason for the desperation of part of humanity, exactly the part that has always tried and still tries to destroy Sacred Symbols. The Light has won! There is no reason to fear anything they want to implant in human consciousnesses. Trust in the Plan! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Profile of a Controller",
        texto: "Beloved ones! There is no possibility of two souls existing with the same consciousness, with the same frequency and that could be said in the same condition within the evolutionary ladder. However, there are many that are similar or that act more or less in the same way; that have much similarity in their degree of understanding and that resemble each other by affinities, by actions and by reactions. In this way, placing them in similar groups, it becomes easier to also understand the individual process of each one. Whenever we say that others are our mirrors, we are wanting to show that, through comparisons, learning becomes easier. By observing the actions of those around us, when one is aware that we are in a school of souls, observing without emphasizing judgment, then lessons are absorbed more easily and more quickly. Earth as a School of Souls offers all learning opportunities within what can be called duality or polarities. The entire path is not the same and not in the same time for all students of this School. However, the one who reaches the end of the journey deserves approval for a School of a higher level. We call this fact Ascension. Humanity is now experiencing a unique moment within this long evolutionary journey. With the arrival of the new energies that promote the Planetary Transition, the greater infusion of Gamma Light begins to dissolve the veils of forgetfulness, and the incarnated souls who are about to ascend will gradually remember who they are, where they came from and why they were here. They will also remember the details of all past lives and all the learning conquered. The human beings incarnated here on Earth now who are ready for ascension, with each passing day, perceive how fast the changes are. They themselves can understand things that were not possible to understand before. The feeling is so heightened that they can actually evaluate each feeling of the one who is nearby or who comes into tune, even at a distance. They can feel even the intentions of the other, even if the other does not demonstrate. We are very close to reaching full Fifth Dimension consciousness. And at this level there will be no more deceptions and no manipulations. This will be the ruler that will determine who is indeed ready for the New Earth, which will also cease to be a World of Expiations and Trials to transform into a World of Regeneration. Currently, we can say that each human being is apt to understand certain situations and can make evaluations according to the real state of their consciousness. Therefore, it is necessary to be careful not to judge, for judgment is always made according to the internal vibrations and understanding of the one who judges. To judge is not to show the truth of the other, but your own exposed truth. When therapeutic work is done, the therapist is in the condition of assisting the one who seeks them. It is the exact moment when frequencies align, both of the one who receives and the one who gives the guidance. And today's text also serves as a therapeutic function. Not to judge people, but to guide them, for many will have the opportunity to understand those around them, and especially if any of you fits the condition of CONTROLLER or even MANIPULATOR. The controller is not an evil soul. It is indeed a soul that has not yet fully finalized learning. Therefore, it understands that others should be exactly like them. They should think, act, execute tasks according to their methodology. They do not accept that someone says something contrary to their beliefs, or that someone contradicts what they say. The Controller has in their unconscious a strong desire to be in command of all actions that involve something or someone that is nearby or that is known to them. It does not matter if the other does it better, it only matters that the other does it the way they would do it. The controller also possesses some edges still to be smoothed. Certainly among them are envy, pride, vanity, intolerance, anger, among others. But there is also still a lot of pain within their memories of past lives. So, the fear of going through pain again makes them demand to always be in control. Unconsciously, they believe that by being in control of everything, nothing will happen that could cause them the pains of the past. The controller generally possesses a charitable soul. The pains of past lives have already polished their soul to such an extent that now they only fear going through the same situations again. This is the reason that makes the controller have the permanent need for validation of their attitudes. That is why they demand so much from others. But deep down they are actually desirous of compliments. The controller is thirsty for these compliments, for the compliment is the way to prove that they are always right. On the other hand, if they receive criticism, it will drive them crazy. This happens because they still blame themselves for their past mistakes that caused them so much pain. Each criticism they receive revives in their subconscious the memories of the hard situations lived in the past. The controller is very bipolar, for they quickly alternate a loving attitude with an angry one. It is not easy to live with them. Many people distance themselves from them for this reason, which leads them to suffer greatly, even if they do not admit it in these cases. As consolation, they try to believe that the one who distanced themselves did not deserve to be in their company. But it is a solitary pain and wounds them mortally every time this happens. Few can actually live with them for a long time. However, as we always say: there are no victims, for the one who calls themselves a victim today was in fact the executioner of yesterday. So, living with the controller is indeed a learning still necessary for such people involved with them. And to leave no doubt, we leave here the observation that the controller is not properly a MANIPULATOR. If the controller is generally a charitable soul, the manipulator in essence is a soul that still needs much learning. Therefore, the manipulator is a person who still takes pleasure in evil and in the subjugation of other incarnated beings. This one is still far from the ascension of their soul. The manipulator takes pleasure in the pain of others. They possess few predicates, but have many flaws in their character, for they are generally proud, greedy, biased, ambitious, etc., but they are aware that they are a failure. So they try to compensate for their failure by imposing themselves on everything and everyone, for they do not tolerate someone being in superior conditions to them. The manipulator is a contumacious unhappy person. They compensate for their unhappiness by causing pain to others. The manipulator needs applause, for it is the only way to feel competent. Their permanent desire for power is also the great wound that mistreats them for a lifetime, for it is a wound that never heals. No matter how much power they achieve, it will never be enough to make them happy. It is a thirst that never ends! Deep down, they consider themselves the most unhappy among humans. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Importance of Conscious Breathing",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The more we understand the beauty and perfection of Divine Creation, the more amazed we become. Even though forces contrary to the Light have strived to impose limiting beliefs on human consciousnesses, nothing can prevent part of humanity from making its ascension now. In the countless previous texts that report on the Planetary Transition and the Ascension of Souls, we left numerous messages on the subject. The awakened consciousnesses begin to broaden very quickly. This brings a different understanding of the reality lived until now. It also brings all the unconscious knowledge that accompanies this soul fractal that is incarnated in human form. Yes, we are indeed at the end of a Great Planetary Cycle! A New Time is approaching, providing the Planetary Transition and our beautiful Blue Planet will no longer be even a shadow of what it was before. New Earth and New Humanity! All souls that incarnated in human form on this Planet collaborated in a certain way for its construction. Many will inherit it for also having achieved their Ascension. And even those who will have to leave it gave, in a certain way, a portion of themselves in this grandiose divine project. New times are approaching and changes are necessary and, at the same time, inevitable. But one should not expect changes from outside to inside. If you contributed to the construction of the New Earth, it was always with something that you already possessed within yourself. So it is also certain that the finishing of this work of art will also have to come by inspiration, that is, from within. You are the architect of the New Earth. Never forget that! But, above all, you are the architect of yourself. You transformed yourself into what you are today, through the construction and execution of each thought, act, or work, through all the hundreds of incarnations here on this Planet. Through the experiences lived, you molded your current consciousness. And it will be this consciousness that will determine the frequency that will enable the ascension or not of each one's soul. But, before ascension, we still need to go through the last lessons and the last learnings in order to obtain the key that will open the Fifth Dimension Portal. They are small details that will not bring great difficulties, at least for those who have already awakened. Always remembering that, for these, the worst is over. Awakening brings the understanding and the most comprehensive comprehension of each thing or situation. The more the consciousness of the awakened expands, the greater is the understanding of the process being lived today on Planet Earth. And the more consciousnesses broaden, the greater is the vibration and the higher becomes the frequency of the entire Planet. We begin to better understand that we are all ONE with the Source. We are all ONE with nature. We are all ONE as humanity and with the life existing in this planetary home. We begin to understand that we are much more supported than could be imagined. And, thus, we begin to transform ourselves into the New Human of the New Earth. The transition does not happen from one moment to another, we have said this so many times. But now, at its end, everything accelerates. Even so, we have the current existence to complete or give the finishing touch to our own architecture. And each one will give their personal and non-transferable touch to their work. What a precious moment this is! Wise is the one who knows how to take advantage of it! But today the text has the purpose of bringing to all of you who read it, a bit of information that the new consciousnesses can already absorb. Let us talk about THE POWER OF CONSCIOUS BREATHING. Breathing is a natural mechanism that keeps beings alive on this Planet. But let us talk only about human beings. Even spontaneously, everyone breathes, for if they do not, they obviously die. But, as it is natural, they do it unconsciously. And this is the great difference that we will address in today's text. Breathing consciously is different. Understanding its power and its benefits is only possible as each one's consciousness expands. Then, we begin to understand why breathing is called THE BREATH OF LIFE. Life would not exist if there were no Light. And the planetary Sun brings this Light that comes from the Central Sun, that is, from the Source. And the Source is where everything is created, and from it everything is sown throughout the infinite Universes. This Light is called PRANA. The pranas are in the solar spectrum, which can be proven through the rainbow. Pranas are seeds of life. They are, at the same time, the maintainers of this life in all corners of the Galaxies. Without Light there would be no pranas. And to keep the pranas active at night, they mix with water and air. That is why living beings do not die when the Sun sets. Having seen this, it is not only oxygen that we need, but also the pranas. So, we need to become aware of this composition of the air and know how to take advantage of it. There are interesting techniques in the practice of breathing. I can mention here an important source about this, which are the techniques called Pranayama Breathing. Research and see how fantastic it is. But you can practice and improve through intuition as well. Remember that your consciousness begins to bring the innate knowledge that is already within you. Practice will take you deeper and deeper into this knowledge. But, to begin such practices, I leave a little guidance here today. Whenever you feel fear, anxiety, anger, desperation, or any other emotional symptom, stop for 10 minutes everything you are doing and breathe consciously. Sit comfortably and close your eyes. Begin to pay attention to your breathing. Feel the air entering your body. Inhale through the nose slowly and deeply, to the point you can manage. Take this air intentionally beyond the lungs, make it reach the abdomen. Then release through the mouth, a little faster than the inhalation. At first, you may not achieve total concentration on breathing, but over time, everything will improve. The results will be felt more and more intensely. This conscious exchange of air promotes the exchange of energies as well. This is because you are in command and you direct the pranas. Pranas are pure energies and, upon reaching the cells of the body, they cleanse the impure energies that cause the unpleasant symptoms mentioned here before. In case you feel pain or physical discomfort in any part of the body, you can also do the same procedure. Breathe as in the previous technique and, when your lungs are full of air, send these pranas through the blood arteries and veins to the point where the pain is. Mentally irrigate this point with the pranas and then exhale the pain out. With practice, you will feel relief whenever you do this and, over time, you will learn to heal yourself from most pains. All healing techniques are valid; however, the result is not always the same for everyone who practices them. It depends on the understanding and consciousness of each one. It also depends on confidence and persistence. But the energies that the pranas bring are always pure and come from the Creative Source of everything there is. It is divine providence offering the support that is never lacking. No one is prevented from using such resources, for they are natural, free, and exist in abundance. Enjoy! Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! Light is the spark that creates life. The Source that is everything is nothing more than where the life of everything that exists in the immensity of the Universes originates. Light is a frequency. Light is also a consciousness. And you are part of this consciousness, that is why we say we are all ONE. At this moment, you are just a fractal of this consciousness, for your Higher Self decided to collaborate in the creation and evolution of Worlds. In truth, you are following the Creator's recommendation, for He said: Go and create, spreading your seeds throughout the Galaxies! You were never obligated to anything, for there is nothing and no one above who can demand this. You are part of the whole and, therefore, you are sovereign. You decided to experience life and the construction of a Third Dimension World, where consciousness is so limited to the point of no longer remembering who it is. You decided to explore and live a world of duality, where Trials and Expiations are the rule and the lever that drives such learning. A world of polarities where this consciousness evolves through opposite experiences, incarnating sometimes in one condition, sometimes in another. You are courageous! You knew that the Terran School is one of the hardest among all in the Universe. But you also knew that support would never be lacking, even if you indeed forget who you are in essence. You were never alone! A true apparatus of protection has always accompanied you and will accompany you until the end of the journey, that is, until the return home. You walked through other worlds before being here on Earth. There the learning was not enough to climb the steps of ascension and return to your higher versions of yourself. So, Earth was another option. And here you are! You feel that now something different is happening. Many times it seems that a metamorphosis is transforming your consciousness. If before, as a caterpillar, you could walk, now you feel like a butterfly that can already fly. As the consciousness that you are broadens, the wings grow and the flight goes higher. There are moments when you rise so much to the point of seeing how limited the world you once believed to be real was. New horizons show themselves as the ascent happens. New realities appear before your eyes. This is encouraging! But it can also bring an anguish never felt before, besides an expectation that the new something always brings, even more when it comes to a Planetary Transition simultaneously with the ascension of the incarnated soul. It is a unique event that the Galaxy experiences and this increases even more the emotion that the great spectacle will provide to each incarnated on Earth. You went so far that you reached the confines of the Nebadon Universe. You traveled through the periphery of this Milky Way Galaxy. You experienced all the teachings that the dark night of the soul provided you. You went as far as you needed to go! You made it! You are a winner! You knew it would not be easy! But even so you decided to accept the experience in order to transform yourself into one of the Ascended Masters of Earth. Such knowledge will be integrated into your higher soul versions and then aggregated to your HIGHER SELF. That is why, after ascension, you will be able to practice all this knowledge, in helping other worlds still in transit in lower Dimensions. At this moment, you have already reached Point Zero. Now the return begins. Your consciousness is still confused, for it has not yet freed itself from all the veils. However, each day, one by one, all these veils will be removed. This is what will provide a broader vision of everything you experienced and even of who you really are. You are leaving behind the necessary illusion of 3D. From now on, despite the doubts that may still temporarily torment you, everything will be more real and faster. In a short time, your consciousness will be able to absorb more and more information and the past will seem like a fairy tale. You will understand that everything was just an enactment in order to gather experiences in a Third Dimension World. Trust! The difficulties from now on are nothing more than frequency adjustments. There are no more Trials or Expiations for those who have already made the turn at Point Zero. The way back will have nothing more to learn. It will, however, have the evaluation of what was learned on the way there. The return will be very fast. It is like a journey going on foot and returning by plane. Thus, what was yesterday, today is no longer. And what is today, tomorrow will no longer be either. You are anxious and restless. You are also distressed, for you resemble that student at the end of the course, waiting for the result of their tests. But if this subject interests you, have no doubt that you did well on these tests. There will be no shortage of points for final approval. Just maintain confidence and perseverance, for some may still give up even being in the final stretch of this journey. Forward, soul brother! Courage and confidence, for you are on the right path! Even if someone still tries to divert you, persist! YOU ARE A LIGHTHOUSE. Upon making the turn at Point Zero, your Light was turned on again. And now it shines enough to show you the way and also to illuminate the steps of those who decide to walk by your side. YOU ARE A LIGHTHOUSE! You are a consciousness of Light! You never stopped being Light, even when you walked through the dark night of the soul. Believe in this and trust! You are a winner! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Ego Is an Existential Void",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The closer we get to the end of this Third Dimension Cycle, the more understanding we have of who we are and what we are. This is good, for it frees consciousnesses as they awaken and rise. The Divine Plan is fulfilled within all the Universal rules that govern each Planet and each Star. Humanity is now taking its last steps within that space that still corresponds to the frequencies of Worlds of Trials and Expiations. As each incarnated soul begins the crossing of the interdimensional bridge, all the knowledge accumulated through hundreds of incarnations on this Planet begins to be remembered. It is impressive how this is all very fast! As we have said here other times, what was yesterday, today is no longer. It can also be noted that in previous incarnations, everything that was planted in one existence was harvested in the following existence. Now it is different, for everything will be harvested immediately, that is, still within the current existence. The revelations will bring the entire history of humanity, both of individual consciousnesses and of the collective. A sample of this are the increasingly lucid dreams and also the countless sensations and symptoms that each one is currently feeling. All the fears accumulated in this current existence and also in previous ones will now manifest in order to be dissolved. The same will happen with anger, guilt, hurt, resentments, and all the negative emotions that each human being went through over the millennia. The decisive moment is now. If in the years 2019, 2020, and 2021 the healing was restricted to the ancestry corresponding to past lives, now in this year, especially in this second semester, the healing is being done in what corresponds to the past within this current life. This is the reason for so many symptoms currently. Pay attention to your dreams and see that they have a close relationship with something you went through in this current existence. This is the energetic cleansing that we must go through in order to adjust to higher frequencies. If this were not done, no one would be able to withstand the flashes of Photonic Light that reach Earth, each day with more power. We are also going through a necessary physical cleansing, since our DNA is being updated. It has already been said that the new human DNA will soon have 12 activated helices, whereas until now only two were active. This update is only possible as the physical bodies manage to detoxify from the chemical products accumulated in their organs and cells. But there are an infinity of necessary changes and each one faces their own demands. Each one has their individual history. And it is in their beliefs and emotions that the work is being done more deeply. It is the famous cleaning of their basements. As Light enters these basements, all the dirt becomes exposed. Thus, it facilitates the necessary work to dissolve such energies and such shadows. Today's theme brings a part referring to the soul baggage that still needs to be sorted and left behind. Unnecessary and useless, it should not be taken beyond the bridge mentioned at the beginning of the text. Let us talk about the EGO. The inflated ego, that is, an emotion, a belief, or even a need that many believe to be beneficial, but that when overdosed is tremendously harmful to the evolution of the soul. The ego is an empty space that needs to be filled. Not by egoic attitudes, but by something altruistic, by something that elevates the soul. The uncontrolled Ego is a treacherous guide that digs the abyss where it throws its follower. The ego builds nothing, only destroys the little that its bearer achieves with great difficulty. In truth, the ego is a certificate of incompetence. When one says inflated ego, we could understand that it is nothing more than an empty bubble, like a balloon full of air. The more it grows, the closer its collapse is, for, when it bursts, nothing useful will remain. Many feel a very great existential void within themselves, compared to an intense hunger. They urgently need to fill that space in order to free themselves from the discomfort of such emptiness. So they create an illusion in order to satisfy such a lack. This illusion is the ego that grows in proportion to the existing space. However, as the days pass, its bearer realizes that all attempts were fruitless. Just like a balloon that deflates over time, that space filled with the ego also dissolves and the need for more ego arises. The more the ego broadens, the greater the space occupied and more and more need arises. This becomes an endless vicious cycle. The ego produces nothing useful. This is the reason it never satisfies the one who holds it. It is just a deceptive appearance camouflaged in the mind of its bearer. It does not even fool anyone, whether the one who is nearby or even a stranger. The inflated ego does not even hide a despicable attitude of the one who carries it, for, as it is something that grows, it ends up showing itself more easily to everyone. The ego also reveals something that no one likes to show: the difference between a winner and a loser. It only identifies, among so many, the least apt for great works. Yes, for the one who actually accomplishes something good does not need this artifice, for they already feel fulfilled all the time. This one does not feel the existential void that the egoic one feels. The one who is competent does not need to prove anything, for their accomplishments speak for themselves. The bearer of the inflated ego tries to show something they cannot have or accomplish. The ego is a void that needs to be filled; not with illusion, but with uplifting things. So, the ego is something that still needs to be understood. Namaste!",

        titulo: "The System Will Self-Destruct",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Earth's humanity has reached the end of the great Cycle of experiences in duality. We are on the bridge that connects a Third Dimension World with a Fifth Dimension World. It is on this bridge that everything will be revealed. You certainly still remember some moment from your past when you participated in the secret friend game. On the day when your secret friend would be revealed, everything was a celebration. Hugs, celebrations, and memories of the gifts received. Expectation dominated the environment and hearts, and the revelations put an end to the long wait. We can compare the current moment of humanity with this game mentioned here. However, there is a big difference: the experience of souls incarnated on Planet Earth is not a game. On the contrary, it is such a great learning that there is no other similar in this Galaxy. So true that only courageous souls qualified to attend this school. And now we are in the times of revelations. As was written in the text that referred to the Apocalypse, such revelations will bring the truth. Everything that was hidden will be shown in a clear and crystalline way. It is the most awaited moment by all souls that are part of the great Terran family. THE SYSTEM WILL SELF-DESTRUCT! But what exactly is this System? In truth, there is no way to define it in a simple word. The System is everything we know and that existed on this Planet Earth, since the beginning of local humanity: the trials and expiations that were part of the experiences lived here and the aggravating factors included by the shadow races that arrived here later. With the coming of such dark races, the System was remodeled and became even harder. The learning of incarnated souls moved to a much higher degree of difficulty, since such races enslaved humanity according to their interests. But everything always has the purpose of the Laws that govern the Universes. We have finally reached the end of this Great Cycle of Expiations and Trials. Planet Earth has entered an octave in the galactic spiral and this changes all the energetic vibration and also the frequency of Light that reaches Earth. So, nothing will be as before anymore! The true history of humanity will finally be revealed! The truths will be shown. The lies and the illusion will be definitively unmasked! Finally, we will know who we really are. You will know that you are not this limited human being. You will finally know that you have other YOUs spread throughout the infinite Universes and that such versions of yourself are also Gods, since everything is always ONE with the Source. The Source is everything there is, for it creates infinitely, whether souls or countless worlds. There is our origin and our truth. You are much more than you think you are! It was the illusion of the Third Dimension and the thick veil that limits consciousness that made you believe that you are this limited being. It was this limitation that provided you with the learning of what it is like to live in the condition of feeling separated from the Source. So now the time has come for the revelation of the truth. It is the final time of this Cycle, announced by the Great Master Jesus, also called Christ, for His energy is Crystal, that is, it is not from this carbon-based world, but from higher worlds. As He Himself said: My Kingdom is not of this World. The prophesied return of Christ is nothing more than the change from carbon-based energy to a definitive crystalline energy. Everything here on Earth will become Christic-based, that is, crystalline. The consciousness of Gaia, of the kingdoms, and especially of humans will be transparent, as it really is in Dimensions above 5D. THE SYSTEM WILL SELF-DESTRUCT. The increase of Light will show the truth. The consciousness broadened by this Gamma Light will vibrate in 5D frequencies and will reveal what was hidden. The truth is nothing more than pure Light and true love. Everything is Light! The consciousness that forms our Monad is pure Light. That is why, when our fractioned soul here in 3D rises to Dimensions above 12D, the form begins to disappear, leaving later only a consciousness of Light. For now, we are on the bridge that separates 3D from 5D. This crossing is very important, for those who cannot achieve the necessary frequency to open such Portals will not be able to cross it. This means that they still lack higher energy, that is, they do not yet possess the vibration that elevates them. Remembering that ascension means rising. The revelation of the truth will show that Earth offered an experience of what it is like to live in illusion. And all the Systems known until now were nothing more than platforms that offered the possibilities of living this illusion. That is why THE SYSTEM WILL SELF-DESTRUCT. Many expect forces from other Planets and other Stars to come and save humanity. It is not quite like that. What will actually happen is the increase of Light. Light shows and reveals everything. So, each human consciousness, as it becomes illuminated, will do the individual process of its ascension. Obviously, those whose veils are still very thick will have the greatest difficulties, and a good part of humanity still does not possess the necessary requirements to dissolve such veils. The positive Extraterrestrial Forces are doing their part. This includes controlling the entry of this Gamma Light into our Planet, so that the process is done as smoothly and peacefully as possible. Everything that is not up to humans to do, they will do. But they cannot do what is up to each of us. This is very important to know and be aware of our responsibility. There will also not be something impactful that determines all the changes in a single moment. This would be catastrophic. However, everything now accelerates. We are on the bridge, as was said before. And here ends a Cycle that corresponds to a World of Expiations and Trials for all those who learned the lessons that the journey offered until here. THE SYSTEM THAT MAINTAINED AND CONDUCTED EVERYTHING UP TO THE BRIDGE WILL NOW SELF-DESTRUCT. We have finally arrived at the time of revelations. We have waited a long time for this! Let us vibrate in joy and confidence, for the eventual difficulties are nothing more than the tiredness at the end of a long marathon. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Brazil Heart of the World",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The ascension process of Earth's souls is long and, therefore, done in stages. Throughout the millennia, each stage was overcome, whether individually or collectively. Ascension is part of the Divine Plan for Planet Earth. Nothing and no one can change the Creator's designs. Everything was strategically planned long before the emergence of our Planet. Earth is destined to be the GARDEN OF EDEN, whether or not its supposed dominators want it. Such dominators came here about 350 thousand years ago. First, as exploiters of our riches, however, over time, the dispute for the command of Planets rich in natural resources subjected the local humanity to slavery through labor and debt. The hardest period for souls incarnated on Earth was undoubtedly the last 25,920 years that correspond to the Pleiadian Cycle, also known as the Mayan Calendar. This Cycle determines the exact time it takes our Solar System to complete an orbit around the Central Sun of Alcyone, which, in turn, commands the Pleiades System. But it is not necessary to go back 26 thousand years to understand such a process. It is enough to just observe the known history of current humanity. From ancient Egypt to the present day, we already have a notion that can explain Earth's current moment. After the sinking of Atlantis (the Atlantean Continent), everything changed here, both in Earth's geography and in its humanity. The reduced population became hostage to the Archon invaders. Through some intruding races, such as the Reptilians and the Draconians, genetic modifications in humans allowed hybridism with such races. If before the Archons had their interest focused only on Earth's riches, now they also decided to enslave its humanity. Genetic experiments transformed part of humans into cold-blooded (reptilian) hybrids. Such hybrids began to act like the dark races that created them. Remembering that all this occurred because the Archons did not have permission to incarnate on this Planet. However, with hybridism, the command and control of humans became easier, since the insatiable desire for power is in the genetics of reptilians. And in the last 13 thousand years, such hybrids came to dominate all the peoples of Earth. As humans in their form, humanity did not even realize it was on the path to slavery, for its commanders always looked the same as the others. Great Empires succeeded each other over the years. Crusades, invasions, wars, destruction of cities, domination, and misfortune, this was the keynote in these dark times. Not to mention that we still had the Inquisition in the Middle Ages that lasted more than 500 years. During this time of Darkness, such dominators divided the conquered territories into parts, just as robber gangs do when dividing the product of theft. This is how countries emerged. In their beginning, they were still under the yoke of their owners, as Brazil was a colony of Portugal and the other Latin countries, dominated by Spain. But even the United States, Canada, all of Africa, and Oceania went through the colonial period. There was a time when it seemed that the Light would finally descend upon such subjugated peoples. So there was also their INDEPENDENCE. It was no different here in Brazil. On September 7, 1822, Brazil gave its cry of freedom, freeing itself from the yoke of the Kings of Portugal and all of Europe, for such Kings were, in fact, families formed by hybrids as described at the beginning of this text. Politically, it is said that there was independence. Just as there was for all the others that were colonized before. But did their people truly enjoy this independence? Certainly not! What happened was that there was a change in the subjugation strategy. The World was getting very large and the population had increased too much. So, like large plundering gangs, they subdivided into more slices of command. As hybrids are always eager for power, nothing more natural than for the World's owners to have no difficulty in subleasing their territories. In theory, the countries freed themselves from colonial government, but in practice, their leaders were nothing more than henchmen of their original bosses. This practice was refined and thus the three-letter Organizations emerged, such as UN, OAS, CIA, FBI, and so many others, all reptilian branches of the dark command. We have arrived at the present day. Times of revelations. Time of the Apocalypse. Everything that was hidden is being revealed. This is necessary for the liberation of humanity. Jesus Christ Himself said: You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free. This truth is now being placed before all humanity. And it is exactly this truth that the Hidden Command does not want to be revealed, for this will determine the definitive end of humanity's slavery. And it is not a mere coincidence that Brazil celebrates its bicentennial on this September 7, 2022, for its definitive liberation was not in 1822, but will indeed be now. There is no chance, there is always a cause. The cause of all this is the role determined for Brazil in this Planetary Transition and that coincides with the End of Earth's Cycle: from Trials and Expiations to a World of Regeneration. Brazil is the Heart of the World, for it is its Heart Chakra. Energetically, everything will flow from here to the rest of the Planet. Its geographical shape, placing the Northeast which is the starting point of the sunrise, we will have exactly the shape of a heart. It is also the Land of the Southern Cross, for it is not by chance that from here we have the best view of this Constellation. Also, intuitively, Cabral's Fleet gave the name of Land of the Holy Cross when sighting Monte Pascoal. Shortly after, it changed to Vera Cruz, and then took the definitive name of Brazil. Brazil derives from ember or burning. It also means fire, a natural element that together with water, air, earth, and ether form Earth's energetic set. The ember is the part of the fire that does not go out. From it, fire can rise again, just needing more wood to feed it. And Brazil was being fed when the Consoler (Kardecism) that arose in France in 1850, not finding burning in those lands, migrated here, bringing the Homeland of the Gospel to the surface of the Planet. FROM BRAZIL TO THE WORLD! This is the password that the Heavens send us! Everything will begin here now. This is also the reason that brought here a horde of dark incarnated reptilians. As if the natives here were not enough, there is a true Legion of them that, even from outside, dictate the rules here, even if this infringes national sovereignty. But nothing will stop the Divine Plans for Brazil and for Earth's humanity. A determination from Above is not discussed, for it simply establishes itself. And the Creator has already said ENOUGH! The Bicentennial of Brazil's Independence means that the Heart of the World is ready to irrigate the rest of the planetary body with its burning blood. The pure blood that will leave its heart will purify the blood of the rest of its body. The millions of hybrids eager for power, even being insignificant characters, fight desperately alongside their own enslavers, for they still feel the incessant thirst to reach the highest levels of command. This is also the way to understand why much of humanity is always on the side of the Hidden Command, which is also the cause of most of the pains of the human race. Brazil will fulfill its role, sooner or later, but nothing will stop what is to come. If the heart stopped working, the entire planetary body would collapse, and this is not part of the Divine Plans for Planet Earth. Therefore, let us vibrate together today! Let us pulse to the rhythm of this heart that will never stop beating! We are the army of Light incarnated at this moment in order to anchor the necessary energy that sustains the cardiac rhythm of Planet Earth. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Leaving Victimhood Behind",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Incredible times are coming for Earth's humanity! The curtains of the Theater of life open, so that everyone can watch their abilities, in the representation of their characters lived in each of their existences, experiencing the polarities in a Third Dimension World. You are no longer the same as before! In fact, you are no longer the same with each passing day. Everything accelerates in this final stretch of the long journey of life and in the experience in illusion. Portals open one after another and everything is revealed as each consciousness is able to understand the changes. The Divine Plan is so perfect that a Third Dimension consciousness still cannot assess its extension. But awakening gradually brings all the assimilation that each incarnated needs, even if not in the same dose for everyone. No one is ever abandoned! And no one ever was before, for the Creator does not lose any of His sheep. In truth, it is necessary to understand that each soul incarnated on Earth came to experience Light and Shadow at the same time and, with consciousness limited to the extreme, all these souls indeed go through the sensation of being disconnected from the Source. This sensation is so strong that it made Terran humanity believe that everything ends with the death of the physical body. However, the disincarnation of the soul is a necessary process, precisely so that it sees that death does not exist. Detached from the physical body, the soul recognizes continued life. In the afterlife, consciousness expands enough so that it can evaluate its performance and learning up to that moment. It will remember that it has had many incarnations before and that it will still need to reincarnate many more times. The time announced by Christ Jesus is really coming to its end. This is the reason for the accelerated changes that most can perceive nowadays. It has already been said that this will be the last incarnation in duality on this Planet Earth. The Planetary Transition coincides with the mass Ascension of at least one third of the currently incarnated humanity. This makes all the difference now. Earth's Timeline has been changed and nothing more can stop what is to come. For the collective, the best is expected, for this Timeline allows a Transition as smoothly as possible. However, individually, each incarnated soul has the free choice of how to make its journey in this final time. From 2012 onwards, the incidence of Gamma Light intensified to such an extent that the changes indeed began to be perceived. Everything favors awakening and individual choices. For those who have eyes to see and ears to hear, there are many alternatives now. The messages coming from the Higher Planes insist on saying that most of the pains and sufferings that many still feel are nothing more than the result of the resistance that the incarnated puts against such changes. Therefore, do not resist! Enter the flow of the renewing wave and surf the crest of this wave. Look at the example of the surfer! He is not intimidated by the force of the sea. On the contrary, the greater the fury of the wave, the more he takes advantage of the moment to surpass himself and overcome the great challenge. We are close to the great dawn of the New Earth. Comparing with the Terran days and nights, we understand that the darkest hour of the night is the one that precedes the dawn. Therefore, in the dawn of a New Time, our soul is also finalizing its darkest hour. Everything will remain only in the memory of the experiences that each one lived in this long 3D journey. We have said so many times that from 2019 you had the opportunity to heal your ancestry. All the pains and all the suffering experienced in past lives now need to be understood in order to be released. Fear, anger, guilt, shame, hurt, resentment, in short, all this low frequency energy needs to be left behind. It is time to review the limiting beliefs that imprisoned us in these energies. To understand that everything was a theater and you were a good actor, representing in each existence a different character, in order to actually experience the polarities within the duality possible on this Planet. There never existed either victim or executioner, for everything was just a theatrical enactment, so that the incarnated soul, subjected to the veils of forgetfulness, could experience as reality each lived situation. Everything seemed so real that deep marks were left in our soul records. Cleaning such records is necessary. This is what we call healing the ancestry. But there is something still very strong in each human consciousness: VICTIMHOOD. It is impressive the high number of incarnated beings who still feel victims of something or someone! And as long as they do not understand how the mechanism of incarnations works, they will not be able to free themselves from this unnecessary suffering. Experiencing the polarities during successive incarnations requires that a soul comes in alternating lives, sometimes as executioner, sometimes as victim. However, as we said before, nothing is real, for everything is just a theatrical presentation. Of course, the sensations and pains remain in the transpersonal memory, but by understanding that everything is learning, such pains should not be postponed and continued to the following incarnations. The moment is of utmost importance for humanity. Understanding this mechanism of the Third Dimension, understanding how learning works in a World of Trials and Expiations, causes such pains to be dissolved and transmuted. In this way, only the learning will continue in the consciousness of each soul. There is not and never was a victim in this school of souls. What there has always been is learning and experiences acquired in each lesson lived. Victimhood is not real, it is just a painful memory of something already experienced, lived, and felt at some moment within so many incarnations that the soul had on this Planet of duality. Therefore, if you still feel like a victim for some reason, be aware that this is not real. It is just an opportunity that your soul asked for, even before incarnating in this current existence, in order to be able to free itself from this burden that you carry from past lives. Understand that everything was just experience and learning. Remember that soon all the memories of past lives will be revived in your current consciousness and you will understand that you were really a great actor. This will promote the definitive healing of all the pains still existing in you. Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! The current events that many can already perceive converge to the finalization of a Planetary Cycle. With each passing day, more and more information arrives for those who have eyes to see and ears to hear. And everything converges in the same direction, that is, to show that we are indeed within the great planetary change. A New Earth is being born and, with it, a new humanity. If before the word Apocalypse caused shivers in most of you, now there is enough understanding to bring comfort and confidence in the future. A new Light arrived on Earth at the end of 2012, bringing the highest energies, thus also initiating the Age of Aquarius, and this will take our Planet to the Fifth Dimension. Fear-based beliefs have been very cruel to Earth's humans. Due to their limitation of consciousness, and also because of the veil of forgetfulness, it was believed that no change for the better could occur. On the contrary, they made us believe that the Apocalypse would be the Armageddon that would one day come to bring the end of humanity and the destruction of the Planet. But that was not the Divine Plan! Nor was it the project of each soul that accepted to go through the experience of polarities in this world of duality. On the contrary, only courageous and highly evolved souls accepted to go through such experiences, subjected to the veil of forgetfulness and extremely limited in their consciousness. Everything accelerates now! What took centuries will now show itself in months or a few years. And the Apocalypse that before frightened so much, now begins to bring confidence, for it is nothing more than the revelation of what was hidden. It is the window that opens so that Light illuminates the environment and shows the reality that could not be perceived before. This Light dissolves the veils one by one and human consciousnesses will begin to remember everything. They will remember who they are, where they came from, and what they came here to do. They will also remember past lives and will have knowledge of the future. They will activate all the innate knowledge, brought from the times when this consciousness was integrated with its Super Soul. It will indeed be a time of revelations! Everything will be exposed! And what is to come is so great that it could not indeed come before, for our limited consciousnesses could not absorb such reality. As we always say: the fruit cannot be harvested before, under penalty of losing it. And not too late either, for it may rot on the tree. The moment of revelations is now. In truth, everything already started in 2012, however, there was a period of four years so that humanity could get used to the new energies. This energy was adjusting the consciousness of each one, according to individual absorption capacity. And today, we have here on Earth a sufficient number of consciousnesses ready to understand the events that will come soon. They will be decisive moments within the final phase of the Planetary Transition. These revelations are not understood by everyone, but at least by a portion of humanity, sufficient so that they can guide the others. You are one of these selfless Light Workers who are incarnated on Earth. You have been prepared for long millennia and will know what you came for. It is not by chance that today you are interested in these subjects of Planetary Transition and Soul Ascension. You are recovering all the cosmic cellular memory. You are dissolving the veils of forgetfulness in order to bring this innate knowledge to your current consciousness. You are a Lighthouse that came to illuminate the paths of others. Everything will be exposed and revealed! First for you and for the other awakened ones. And you, like a great army, will occupy the entire Planet and guide the others. Everything will be intense and deep. The new energies will break the bars that imprisoned Earth for all times and you, with your Light, will guide those who will begin to open their eyes. Many will need you. Even the one who does not yet know what their mission is will know what to do, for everything will come from inside out. It is as if they always knew! It is as if they had never forgotten! Everything will be revealed like a magic trick. It will indeed be a Great Event! It will be the EVENT that is talked about so much, but that is still little known. And it will not be just an isolated event; there will be many events in cascade, which in the end will show a New Earth and a New Humanity. The Old Cycle is closing. The bars dissolve. Earth is liberated. Gamma Light intensifies. Consciousnesses broaden. Truths are shown. Limited beliefs dissolve in the Light. All of this may seem frightening, but in reality, it will be a moment of jubilation for Earth's humanity and for all quadrants of the Galaxy. The masks will fall and the soul of each incarnated human being will be revealed! A naked soul cannot hide anything. Everyone will know the best kept secrets of each one. Everyone will understand that everything was an experience in the Great Theater of Life. There will be no judgments as before. Everyone will understand that each one was learning their lesson according to their Soul Plan. Everyone will understand that there was never Evil and Good as was supposed, but that everything was always learning. And everyone will remember their own experiences of all lives incarnated on Earth. Upon remembering everything, you will know that your soul will also be exposed. It will also be naked and everyone will know of your trajectory. And no one will judge anyone. Everything will be exposed and everyone will finally understand that everything was just an illusion of consciousness, necessary to experience duality within the polarities in a Third Dimension World. Everything will be exposed! What was hidden will be revealed. This is the Apocalypse so feared while consciousness was sleeping. But now the times have come. Everything was announced by the Governor of this Galaxy, Sananda, who became human only to leave us the Good News, that is, the comforting message that a New Time would come, bringing a New Earth. This time has come! A New Era arrives. Times to be celebrated and not feared! Now everything will be exposed! And as the Great Master said: YOU SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL SET YOU FREE. Free yourself! You can! Namaste!",

        titulo: "Mastery Is the Responsible Use of Power",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Human consciousness is beginning to get rid of the veils, for the learning time here on Earth is coming to an end. As has been said so many times, such learning would not be possible if consciousness were at the original frequency of the soul, that is, at the same level as before incarnating here for the first time. There are so many possibilities within a World of Expiations and Trials! But today we will address only one of them, probably the most important: MASTERY. Lately, the number of incarnated beings who become aware of the existence of the Ascended Masters is increasing. Remembering that the White Brotherhood is just a small portion of these Masters. There are, therefore, infinite other ranks that are not yet shown, for those of the White Brotherhood work directly in helping Earth's humanity. Ascended Masters are souls that went through successive incarnations here on Earth and made their ascension before the Planetary Transition, that is, before Planet Earth becomes a World of Regeneration, which corresponds to the Fifth Dimension. So, all those who completed their learning in recent times no longer needed to reincarnate here, however, some of them decided to continue on Earth's Plane, in order to assist those who still need learning here, like all those currently incarnated. These Masters are part of a legion called Ascended Masters of the Great White Brotherhood. What most incarnated beings still do not know is that all those who came to experience duality on this Planet Earth, when they reach the frequency of the Fifth Dimension, make their ascension and also become Ascended Masters. You will be one of them too! Even those who will have to leave Earth now upon disincarnation, for they are not at the necessary frequency for the New Earth, will continue their evolution in other Worlds of Trials and Expiations, until they reach the 5D frequency and will also make the ascension, becoming Masters like those who have already done so, or do so now in these times of Transition. The Ascended Master has nothing more to learn in a Third Dimension World; however, they can choose whether they want to inhabit the higher Worlds or whether they wish to assist those who are not yet ready for ascension. This premise enables you to choose when ascending in these final times of transition. You can enjoy life on the New Earth or assist the exiled humans, going to one of the Planets where those who are not yet at the 5D frequency will be taken. As has been said here other times, most will want to enjoy the New planetary Home they helped to build, at least for a certain time. However, you will have free will of choice, if you wish to accompany family members and friends who will not be able to inhabit the New Earth. All those who make the ascension, being, therefore, in 5D, will know where those who still remain in 3D are. The opposite is not possible, and you all know this, for you just have to look at today. You do not know where your family members who have already ascended are. The 3D consciousness cannot see or understand what is in 5D and above. To ascend is to rise, to elevate oneself. You already know this. But today I will leave here the message of how to transform yourself into an Ascended Master. Summarizing in one phrase: MASTERY IS THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF POWER. The Ascended Master gains this condition when they manage to reach MASTERY. The responsible use of power is the key that opens the doors of ascension. When the soul decides to experience a school in the Third Dimension, it does not lose its power. It just forgets everything, including that it can do everything. As was said in the last channeling: the soul came to bring the Light and create in duality, sometimes in this Light, sometimes in shadow. By doing its experiences in duality, the soul needs to make good use of its power, even if it does not even remember that it has it. Most of the time, the incarnated believes that power is being in command always. It is not true. You never, at any moment, stopped having power. In every minute during a life as an incarnated being, you always had the power of decision. It does not matter the position, the function, or the social status, you always have your power. The big mistake was believing that others can do more than you. Especially within certain hierarchies as known on Earth. If you are a president, a director, a sector chief, an employee, a street sweeper, a freelancer, or a housewife, just to cite a few examples, in each function you are sovereign in your decisions; therefore, you are exercising your power. Many believe that the other is more powerful just because they assumed a higher position. This is a big mistake, for what changes is only the responsibility. The higher the position within what we believe to be status, is nothing more than an increase in responsibility, consistent with the function. MASTERY IS THE RESPONSIBLE USE OF POWER. Within successive reincarnations, everyone had the opportunity to hold different positions, both those of greater responsibility and those of lesser responsibility. And it was precisely there that each one showed whether they are already qualified to be an Ascended Master or not. It does not matter what function you are in today. This is just the one that shows the result of all learning within hundreds of incarnations. If you do not assume responsibility within your function today, you did not know how to use it when you were in higher positions. And if this still occurs, then you are not ready to ascend, that is, you have not yet reached Mastery. You cannot be an Ascended Master yet. Even the one who has no job, position, or any important task can practice their Mastery in daily life, within idleness. How they use water, the necessary resources like food, the destination of their household waste, their way of living with others, their interest in ethical things or not, their speech, their opinions, in short, what they defend or what they stimulate. Their energetic frequency will tell if they are using their Mastery responsibly. To side with what is ethical and moral is to positively exercise Mastery. Even though everyone has already heard the famous phrase: Do you want to know a person, give them power, now you know that you do not even need to give a high position to know someone. You can know the other just by observing. Even a simple word can show who has reached Mastery or not. All of this is now being allowed, at the End of a Cycle, a moment when a good part of humanity will ascend. We still have a few years for Mastery to be actually adjusted in each consciousness. But time is urgent! You can already feel this acceleration and nothing will stop what is to come. A New Earth is on the horizon line and ALL THOSE WHO WILL BE USING MASTERY RESPONSIBLY will rise to the frequencies of the Fifth Dimension. You are here to become an Ascended Master. Take advantage of this incredible opportunity that has been allowed to you. Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! The eyes of the world were turned to Brazil on this October 2, 2022. It could not be different, for much is being decided now, within the direction that humanity will take. Not only were physical eyes looking at Brazilian lands, but mainly the eyes of those who do not possess physical form, that is, the ethereal entities. Earth and its humanity fulfill a Divine Plan established even before the creation of this Planet. Despite the Archon invasions that tried to establish Darkness here, nothing will prevent humanity from following its established purpose. Everything that has been transmitted so far is just a tiny sample of what it actually is. And the most important continues within what is determined. Small setbacks may occur; however, they will not change the Greater Plan. If the eyes of the Light are attentive and vigilant, the eyes of the non-Light also turned to the Homeland of the Gospel. They know that from here will come the Light that will definitely bathe the Planet. A last attempt by the dark ones to prevent the end of a Cycle dominated by darkness was put into practice now. A great invasion of extra-physical beings joined forces and headed to Brazil in recent months. All these egregores still remaining on Earth's Crust arrived in the Brazilian Astral. The objective would be to prevent the victory of the Light in the Lands of the Holy Cross. Taking advantage of the incarnated who align with such vibrations, they used all possible tools in order to obtain the results they needed. Black Magic gained strength and somewhat darkened the bluish mantle of Planet Earth. But the Divine Plan cannot be changed by any force other than the one who created it. A strategy used and even widely practiced by all incarnated beings is the one used when you want to capture animals easily: the best thing to do is to gather them all in the corral. That is what happened. All the remnants of the non-Light that had not yet been removed were now gathered in Brazil's atmosphere. There was indeed the removal in one single stroke of all the remaining egregores. You cannot see this in physical form, but in the vision of the soul's eyes everything is very clear. In due time, the revelations will reach the physical eyes as well. The Great Divine Plan is in its final moves. Nothing will be as before anymore, for so the Creator projected. You just need to understand this. No one wins and no one loses, for what remains in the end is the learning of each incarnated soul. Truth is that each soul is choosing its Timeline according to its frequency. It will be this frequency that will determine the one who will go to the New Earth and the one who will leave it definitively. The events serve only to show what could not be understood before. The Cleansing is being done on the physical Plane and is going to its end. Remember the messages brought here since 2016. The sweep started at the top of the pyramid and now is at its base. Very little still remains to be done. On the Astral Plane everything is shaped and has already happened. Now it remains to materialize in matter so that physical eyes can see. There is nothing you can do except keep your vibration high. Today just do that. Trust and raise the frequency, trusting in the Divine Plan. Nothing is by chance, for there is always a cause. In four weeks, exercise your power of decision. It will align with the Light or move away from it, for what is being decided now in Brazil is much more than a simple political result. But, until October 30, Earth's blue will be restored, for all the dark clouds will have been dissipated. It does not matter what each one interprets about this reflection, for what matters is the frequency in which each one is and will be from now on. Remember that the Universe does not read words or actions, it only takes into account the frequency of each one. Words and actions can deceive people, but they do not deceive the one who commands the Divine Plan. Namaste!",

The moment is unique, for it will promote the awakening of humanity. The long night is finally coming to its end, as was announced to all of you, even before accepting the journey of this Terran path. You forgot everything you knew before coming here. This process of consciential amnesia was necessary, for without it, you would not be able to have the experience of what life is like at the farthest point from the Source, without even knowing who you are. The duality between Light and Shadow has always been the rule in this School of Souls. You came from the Light and plunged into the Shadows of the Third Dimension. Besides individual learning, you also brought knowledge to those who were already here living their primary phase in terms of growth and ascension. You brought a little Light to this world of shadows. Like a lighthouse on the seashore, you guided, in a way, other souls that were still groping in the dark. You forgot that, before starting this journey in the density of the Third Dimension, you were ONE with God, for your consciousness is part of the Source that is everything. You forgot that you are part of the very consciousness of the Creator of everything there is in the infinite Universes. You forgot that you are the part that is in the whole, and that the whole is in you. You are a Divine Seed-Atom and, as such, an atomic energy that creates just like your Father Creator of the Universes. You forgot that before, your consciousness was ONE with HIM. The warmth of His infinite love was one heart, one Source, one energy, one frequency. A seed that can reproduce other and more trees like the one that originated it. Your origin is pure Light and it is this Light that you will become again now. DO NOT SLEEP NOW! The trumpets of the Angels have already sounded! WAKE UP! AWAKEN! A New stronger and more radiant Sun already shines out there. Even if the light of this Sun dazzles your eyes at first, become aware of the NEW that arrives. LIGHT is information. It tears the veils of forgetfulness and frees you from the illusion of the Third Dimension. Wake up! Do not sleep now! Look at the signs! Look at the skies! You were told that the signs would come from Above. Look up and see Heaven descending and Earth rising. This is the long-awaited moment: the meeting of Earth and Heaven. Those below raise their consciousness to unite with those who are above. There will be many reunions now. Your entire Monad awaits you radiant with joy and jubilation, for you made it! Everyone knew you would make it! You also knew, that is why you offered yourself for this experience so difficult, yet rewarding. Now you will be an Ascended Master. Yes, you will be, for you are making your ascension. And you will take all the knowledge acquired in duality to your own higher consciousness versions. You will take this knowledge to your Higher Self, to the Source, to the Creator, to other worlds and other Universes. As a Seed, you will spread other versions of yourself. And so creation never ceases! DO NOT SLEEP NOW! Hear the crackling of fireworks, announcing the victory of those who arrive at the finish line. You are a winner! You overcame the Darkness without even knowing that you are pure Light! You created so much in duality that you transformed yourself into a Master, a Master of yourself. This Mastery will be useful later, when opportunities arise to help Worlds still in duality, where other brothers also decide to experience the Trials and Expiations, at a certain point far enough from the Source. DO NOT SLEEP NOW! Enter the flow of mass awakening, for the final hour approaches. The lights on the horizon are already stronger. Have eyes to see and ears to hear, for your name is already being written on the list of the approved. Your name is already being announced on the microphones at the top of the podium. See! Hear! Do not sleep now! The one who chooses to sleep a little longer will not be forgotten, for a Father never forgets a child of His. They will be supported, welcomed, and comforted later. All assistance will be provided before starting a new journey in another planetary home, one among so many that will be available for those who do not choose to wake up now. There they will continue their learning until they feel ready for their ascension. No one is abandoned! But you who are waking up, keep your eyes open. Even if you need a greater effort, do not sleep now! Do not miss the spectacle that begins soon! You helped set up the stage and played an important role within this scenario. You were a perfect actor. You learned to create within the polarities between Light and Shadow. From the Light you came, and to the Light you will return now. You are the living experience and will show how it is done. Many are eager for your accounts. Now you will be the Master! DO NOT SLEEP NOW! Find a place in the bleachers of life and watch now your long history. Watch your extraordinary journey within the density of the Third Dimension. Unite with your Greater Self, that is, with your higher consciousness versions, and feel at home! You are returning home now! Savor the taste of victory. Celebrate! DO NOT SLEEP NOW! Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! The time of revelations has arrived. Nothing more will remain hidden, neither before the eyes nor before consciousnesses. We are in the last phase of the Transition, exactly the one that precedes the greater Event, the one that will break the threads that still connect us to the Third Dimension World. All Systems known to humanity will undergo a reset so that the reinitializations of the New Systems can be activated. The expectation of the incarnated soul is great now. Even though human consciousness still cannot comprehend the grandeur of such events, the soul in its highest version clearly glimpses what is to come. With each passing day, more and more consciousnesses previously wrapped in the veils of forgetfulness begin to expand their understanding, allowing each incarnated being to have the opportunity to awaken from the long dark night of illusion. What you did not understand a year ago now seems so familiar! Subjects you were not interested in before now begin to make sense. What seemed fiction before now seems to be indeed an acceptable reality. And everything that seemed real begins to show itself illusory. Yes, you are waking up! The high frequency energy that arrives on Earth now provokes such opportunities. All the awakenable ones will now have a propitious time to open their eyes definitively. There will be no more illusions for this portion of humanity. We have said so many times that the Planetary Transition is in its final moments. At least one third of the incarnated will be able to ascend in this current incarnation. Remembering also that this is the last opportunity, since there will be no other incarnation in duality here on Planet Earth. There was enough time for all souls to prepare. Hundreds and even more than a thousand previous incarnations, most of the incarnated have already had. No one will be able to say that they did not have time to learn what duality means. Everyone went through the possible and imaginable polarities offered by this School of Souls. Time runs out quickly now! What took Centuries before can now take only a few months. Time is urgent for all of us! Wake up! Do not sleep now! See the text from last week, October 12 of this year 2022. The hour is already late and many will not realize that time is also running out. The Portals of ascension are already open. It is necessary to pass through them in order to reach the New Earth. When the gong sounds, they will close for the latecomers and nothing more can be done for their benefit. There was no lack of messages or messengers bringing the Good News. There was no lack of opportunities to redeem oneself from bad actions. There were no lack of signs coming from all sides and from Above. But it was always said that there would have to be ears to hear and eyes to see. Understanding the objective of each one being here incarnated on Earth. Everyone was warned! Insistently warned! Now the separation of the chaff from the wheat is finalized. NOW EVERYONE WILL KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN VALUE AND PRICE. Value and price are quite different things. Many incarnated gave more importance to ethical and moral values and to qualities conquered through hard trials. While others merchandised through the price of each act or action. A man who has value has conquered riches in Heaven. The one who determined a price for each act or action conquered goods that will cease to exist, for they are ephemeral. They will be worth nothing to him now. On the contrary, what had a price will have to be redeemed, since all debts must be paid. Many prefer to sell themselves in order to obtain worldly advantages. These have a price. Others prefer to build a life based on the righteousness of each act, always respecting everything and everyone, living their days in their most perfect conscience of ethics and responsibility. These are humans who have value. Value can serve as currency in exchange when crossing the Portals of Ascension. The price is the quota to be paid before crossing the Portals. So now you begin to better understand such differences. The price is the amount to be paid, and this has no other possibility. Value is what is really worth, and there is no money in the world that can pay for it. Many incarnated allow themselves to be bought and for this they set a price. They spend such accumulated resources on worldly things, for what is easily gained is also easily consumed. Like merchandise, they are traded. Remembering here the parable of the Merchants of the Temple. These will not inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, that is, they will not go through the ascension that will lead to the New Earth. Those who honored moral values earned the merit to inherit the New Earth. And this is priceless! There is nothing in the world that can buy such a precious good of such value. Do not create fortunes on Earth to the detriment of the riches of Heaven. This message alone summarizes everything that is written in today's text. Many allow themselves to be sold for any trinket. In these times of elections, we see how there are still people who have a price. Interests are sold or bought by those who have no value. They merchandise in the Sacred Temple their soul. They serve the interests of a few to the detriment of many. Have you already calculated how many sell themselves for R$ 100.00? They are the ones who do not value themselves. They sell themselves for so little! Even those who sell themselves for millions. Little do they know that it will be the price they will have to pay, multiplied by all the harm they caused to other people, for the redemption will require the price added to all the suffering caused through such a greedy gesture. Perhaps it is time for each one to evaluate their moment. Do you have value or just a price? Namaste!",

        titulo: "Energy Updates",
        texto: "Beloved ones! There is a request from Above for incarnated humanity to keep their energy elevated. The moments of Planetary Transition are increasingly intense and important, especially for those who wish to make the ascension of their soul. Ascension depends on the state of consciousness of each incarnated soul. It is not the body that ascends, for it is ephemeral and lasts only the necessary time requested by the soul that reincarnates. The soul always survives, for it is immortal. A good part of humanity is now in its time of ascension. The Portals are open and passage through them depends on the vibratory frequency of each one. Remembering that, among so many requirements, the three most important are unconditional love, compassion, and respect. If one of these requirements is missing, it is not possible to pass through all the Portals of ascension. We had a Solar Eclipse yesterday. We will have a Lunar Eclipse on November 8th. Such Eclipses are important both in opening Portals and in raising the frequency of each incarnated being. They also facilitate the cleansing and removal of remaining negative energies here on Earth. These are the final moments of the most important events that precede the Great Solar Flash. Much is already defined and has already happened behind the scenes, within Earth's Divine Plan. Even if most do not even notice, they are important pieces within this process. Nothing will stop what is to come; however, each incarnated soul will decide its destiny now, within the current incarnation. Everything has already been learned and each consciousness can now decide for itself. There is not a single living soul on this Planet that can later claim that they did not know the consequences of their attitudes. Everyone knows and knows very well! Even so, many prefer to postpone their ascension, for the Ego and pride are still very strong within them. In the coming days and also within a time that will not exceed a few years in Earth's calendar, we will have the real sample of what is happening with humanity on this Planet. These are indeed the long-awaited final movements. Each incarnated soul knew of these events even before accepting to come to experience life on this Planet of Expiations and Trials. Keep your frequency now! It will be fundamental for your ascension. It will also be of utmost importance for the collective, since each awakened consciousness has an anchoring and creation potential compared to a thousand non-awakened consciousnesses. Many already vibrate so high that they can balance their energy with 50 thousand, 500 thousand, and even more people around themselves and the Planet. See how important you are now! Do not underestimate your capacity to maintain the energy of the collective and of Earth! Do not waste such opportunities. Avoid stress despite the circumstances. Avoid discussions! Do not get into confrontation! Do not offend and do not judge! This would only serve to feed the energy of non-Light. Remember that only Light creates. However, if you feed non-Light, you will create obstacles for your own creation and also for the collective. You have already gone through the necessary experiences, even if you do not remember now. You are one step away from completing the journey within the Third Dimension. Do not get attached to the group that is not ready yet. Do not go back under any circumstances. Not now! The Portals of ascension await you just ahead. Keep your Light! Keep your focus! Keep your frequency and your vibration. Such attitudes will make it easier for you to achieve your goals. Remember this: EVERYTHING IS FREQUENCY! If you wish to obtain something higher, elevate yourself! It is the Law of attraction. Nothing can reach you if you do not have the frequency that can attract that something. Words are not enough; vibration, energy, magnetic compatibility are needed. In the coming days and also for the rest of this year, anchor only energies from the Light. Just a small group of conscious awakened ones is enough to balance the energy of millions of people. Know the importance of all this, for you are not incarnated now for any other reason. You came to anchor the Light and help in the process of planetary Transition and Ascension of souls. Even though no one can change the Divine Plan for Earth, you, I, and many others can make a difference, making it easier for others, even if they do not have the same consciousness. You can transform, change, and improve everything now. But you can also contribute to more difficulties falling upon humanity. Make your life and the lives of others easier! You are co-creator of your reality and also, by extension, of the collective's reality. Focus always on the intention of good! Intention is always the key that opens all doors and now also the one that opens the Portals of Ascension. You have this key. Do not lose it and do not waste it! Namaste!",

        titulo: "What No One Told You",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The last moments of each human being, those that precede the disincarnation of the soul, which we wrongly call death, for the soul is immortal, are very similar for the vast majority of those incarnated here on Planet Earth. The exception is only in cases where so-called sudden death happens; in the others, there is a certain time for consciousness to reevaluate its incarnation that is being concluded. Moments before disconnection, the dying person sees on their mental screen their entire life from childhood to the present moment. As if watching the movie of their life. They are quick moments, but enough for their entire life story in this current incarnation to be clearly visible. It is at this moment that they feel a comforting peace or also an indescribable horror. If they deserved peace, in this more elevated state of their consciousness they already begin to glimpse scenes of an Angelic world. This provokes in them a confidence they never felt before. However, if the movie is horror, the images that follow in their mind are of monsters and Dantesque scenes, which provoke a fear never felt in bodily life. But it is also necessary to take into account another important fact, this one reported by many doctors, nurses, and even by family members who were present beside the bed of a terminally ill patient. Invariably in these cases, what is heard from the one who is ending bodily life is the same feeling, especially in relation to their acts and actions. At this time, what matters most to them is not their possessions, the positions they held, the power they exercised, nor the trips or parties they attended. It does not matter if their team won many championships; if success was easy or difficult, lawful or illicit; if their house was simple or a castle. What matters in those moments is what they could have done and did not do, especially the good deeds. Very common is to feel a very strong regret even for small things not practiced, like hugging their loved ones; saying that they loved them; taking a little time especially with their children while small; a generous look at their wife or husband; a greeting to their neighbors, their friends or collaborators or employees. In short, everything they could have done and did not do. These two stages, although here reversed in the order in which they happen, precede the moment of disincarnation. Both bring a comforting comfort or a desperate anguish, since time runs out and nothing more can be done. The soul that reaches this point already begins to reap the fruits of its sowing during the current incarnation, which is coming to its end. Then, death as it is known, arrives softly, to such a point that they do not even realize they have disincarnated. No one feels the exact moment, not even those who perfectly understand how such a process proceeds. We could compare it to sleep. You do not notice the exact moment when you start sleeping. Death is no different. The minutes, hours, and days that follow disincarnation, these are indeed very different for each soul. There are also totally different situations for each one, all according to the way of life lived before disincarnating. This part is very well explained through the codification of Spiritism made by Allan Kardec. But there is also much information brought by the disincarnated spirits themselves, who manifest during mediumistic works, whether in Spiritist centers, in Umbanda centers, in quantum therapy rooms, and so many other moments and places. My experience acquired in communication with these Spirits qualifies me to speak of infinite possibilities of what happens to the soul after disincarnation. But what really matters is that each of you has very well delineated in your consciousness the following: there is nothing that can be done after disincarnation. Everything is decided here, in consciousness, while we are incarnated. Soon after disincarnation, the soul feels somewhat disturbed, for it does not know that it has disincarnated. It sees itself in a body and, at the same time, sees its own body as if it were another person. Then it sees its own funeral. It tries to communicate with people, for it hears everything they say, including their thoughts. However, no one pays attention to it. In short, this confusion can last a few hours, days, or years. It depends on how each one understands life before disincarnating. As I said here, everything is sequence and also consequence. Regret is also an unpleasant companion in the afterlife. The soul, after convincing itself that it has disincarnated, begins to remember its last incarnation, detail by detail and, upon recognizing its actions that were not aimed at good and evolution, an inconsolable pain arises, which can last a short time or even centuries, even though the impression of time there is different. In fact, it is a sensation of time, for it is not real. After this time, the soul receives the opportunity to be taken to the Rectification Chambers in Earth's Spiritual Colonies. Supported, cared for, and healed of its pains, for the spiritual body can still be feeling some pain from the physical body it had before disincarnation, it begins in the small works of the house, also in assisting those who continue to arrive at that Colony. Even so, the memories of past lives are permanently in its consciousness and it knows that it needs to reincarnate in order to complete or at least follow in its soul evolution. Then begins the preparation of a New incarnation Plan, and this Plan is the matrix that will direct everything it needs to live, experience, and change in its next incarnation. Everything that was placed in the Plan will come at a certain time in its next bodily life. That is why we say that no one escapes from themselves and also that no one goes through what they do not need to go through. I will not speak here of the soul of incarnated beings who take pleasure in evil, for there are certain levels of consciousnesses that do not go through this in the afterlife. They are souls so low in their frequency that they do not follow this path. They go directly to the Lower Umbrals or are kidnapped by dark entities soon after their disincarnation. These are still very far from going through the process described in this text. Remembering that Earth is making a Planetary Transition, thus leaving being a World of Expiations and Trials and will become a World of Regeneration. We are in the last incarnation before this Transition. Therefore, everything is resolved now. Upon disincarnating, each soul will have the destiny according to its frequency. This vibratory frequency will be the passport of each one and will be definitive, for time runs out. The Old Earth is being left behind. Nothing and no one can prevent this, for it is part of the Divine Plans. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Parallel or Simultaneous Timelines?",
        texto: "Beloved ones! When we speak of Timelines, we are referring to a certain situation different from what was considered normal until then, or else to the continuation of what always was. Therefore, when it is said that there was a change of a timeline, the reference is about what is going to change, that is, that nothing will be as before anymore. Normally, a Timeline affects the collectivity. It has little importance when it affects a single person or a very small number of the collective. Such Timelines can also interfere with the Planet as a whole, that is, change enough to cause a Planetary Transition. We have already talked about this here before. We said that a New Timeline in 2010 changed Earth's destiny. The old Line that determined Armageddon was extinct and, in its place, arose the one that will provide a smoother and more harmonious Planetary Transition. All Planets and their humanities go through profound transformations at some determined period within infinite time, like the one we are going through now on this Planet Earth, for example. This is part of the Plans of the Creation of worlds. But today we are going to talk about something very interesting, which is happening in these last months of 2022. We are experiencing a situation that has never been felt before: LIVING TWO SIMULTANEOUS TIMELINES. First, let us understand that Timelines can be antagonistic, parallel, or simultaneous. The difference between them is easy to understand. Antagonistic is when you live a totally different reality from other people. Parallel is when you live two different realities, however, sometimes one, sometimes another, distinctly. You have the exact notion of the difference between them. Simultaneous Timelines are a confusion of things as if it were a fruit salad. Today we are going to clarify about Simultaneous Timelines, for it is what is most in evidence at this end of 2022. It is very likely that, after understanding this, you can get some relief from the tension that accompanies the current days. Understanding what is happening will give you some peace within the turmoil we are going through. When in previous messages you were told that each one is choosing a Timeline according to their frequency, and that they will lead you to opposite directions very soon, in truth it was about the present moment and the days that will come from now on. If it is the frequency of each consciousness that determines who will make their soul ascension now, it is obvious that it will also be this frequency that will direct each one to one or the other Timeline. But it is not an event that can be seen in a single day. On the contrary, such a fact may take a few years, but it will not really be a long time. We are at the apex of this moment. The year 2022 will indeed be a marker as was said at the end of 2021. Even if this is not yet very clear, we will see later how everything proceeded. Individual choices will determine which definitive Line will be followed. Pay attention to your feeling. You are no longer the same being as before. There is something intriguing within your feeling. Forget the old beliefs a little and allow yourself the new. At least accept the possibility that nothing will be as before anymore. Do not resist what your intuition is telling you. Believe in multiple possibilities. Nothing of what was until now will be from now on. Do small meditations and feel your body, your inner voice, and your heart. Learn to hear the voice of your soul. It is guiding you now like never before. But it is necessary to separate the old beliefs and allow yourself the new. New realities are emerging ever faster and you may get into mental confusion or existential conflicts. This confusion is caused exactly because you are living two Timelines simultaneously. It is easy to identify this. See how there are moments when it seems that you are no longer you. Then it seems to return to normal. There are situations that seem to have been lived in remote times and then you understand that it is indeed real, that it is happening now. There are also moments that seem like you are dreaming, but then you see and recognize that it is not a dream. In short, the sensation of what is real and what is not is confused all the time. This is living two Simultaneous Timelines, which can also at some moments be two Parallel Timelines. The difference is that the Simultaneous Timeline is shorter in terms of duration and is more confusing. The Parallel Timeline is felt for a longer time and the difference between them is more visible. What we have to say today is that today's Simultaneous Timelines will settle into Parallel Timelines soon. And, further ahead, they will indeed be the two opposite Timelines that will determine the direction of each soul incarnated here on this Planet Earth. It depends on the adjustment that each one can still make in terms of vibratory frequency. Each human being incarnated at this moment has one last choice now. It will be decisive, for this is also the last incarnation in duality on this Planet. The opportunity offered by the Divine Plan is so great that it makes each incarnated soul feel the multiple vibrations, so that each one can know how to choose their path without any doubts. This imbroglio in feeling is what gives the North so that each one chooses according to the current stage within the evolution of each incarnated soul. Remembering that everything is frequency and that Universal Laws do not read words. No one can deceive their own conscience. We still have a little time, but the funnel is narrowing. The Timelines are available to everyone and each one will be able to make their choice now. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Many Fear What Can Help Them",
        texto: "Beloved ones! There is much updated and available information for all those who seek learning or clarification in the current days. This is part of the final process of a Planetary Cycle, for the Divine Plan offers all possibilities for each soul incarnated on Earth. No one will ever be able to claim that they did not have an opportunity. As a School of Souls, our Planet offers the same lessons to all its students, even if at different times. The phrase that heads today's text I saw in a message transmitted by Aurora Ray, great channeler in these times of Planetary Transition. Such a phrase is inspiring me to say something to you today. We are crossing the Interdimensional Bridge and there is no more time to lose. The Old Cycle is closing and a New Era is emerging just after the Bridge. Earth's humanity came to this School with the objective of experiencing duality, following the Laws of Cause and Effect, whose consciousness in the form of a Fractal indeed felt separated from the Source, for the veil of forgetfulness made it impossible to remember anything prior to the current incarnation. We have already said here other times that most of the souls incarnated here have already had hundreds of incarnations, that is, an average that goes from 600 to 1,100 passages through bodily life. Within this quite long time, everyone was able to experience one by one all possible and imaginable possibilities. There is nothing in this World that you have not experienced at some point within this long journey as a human being. Now the time has come for change in this School. The curriculum will change to a higher level. All those who are approved will make their ascension. A new reality is coming. Learning will continue, however, no longer on the basis of Trials and Expiations, that is, on the basis of pain and suffering as was this first Cycle, which is beginning to close. Many experiences until now were very traumatic. Certain consciousnesses, although ready for the new School, have not yet recovered from these traumas. They are transpersonal memories that are still within the baggage of each soul. Some more expressive, such as guilt, anger, fear, victimhood, shame, and resentment are still active in such memories. Limiting beliefs can also greatly hinder the crossing of the bridge now. Many lies imposed over the centuries created false truths in the consciousness of many. Adding all this up, we still have the resistant ego within us. The ego always seeks a known state of consciousness, that is, the comfort zone. It firmly resists any change, even if it is for its benefit. Whenever some difficulty arises in life, invariably it is a message from the soul telling the consciousness that occupies that physical body that there is a lesson, a learning, a redemption, or a change to be made. This is the reason why the soul needs a physical body with each reincarnation. The body is the sounding board of the soul and it always expresses itself through it. Understanding the language of the body helps in the process of understanding and in making decisions regarding the changes that need to be made. And here enters the phrase that heads today's text: MANY FEAR WHAT CAN HELP THEM. But what is the reason for this? Let us try to explain the main reasons. The beliefs that each one carries within are based not only on the experiences lived, but mainly on what was imposed from outside in. The lie, the misinformation, and the deception practiced for millennia made human beings believe in interpretations that do not match reality. Very little of what was learned is real. Remembering here that humanity was controlled by a group of dominators, since the Archons arrived here. Another factor that brings fear are the traumas still rooted within the unconscious memories of each one. Those natural experiences that the incarnated soul needed to go through many times left sequels caused by pain and suffering when going through such experiences. Another also unconscious cause comes from past lives, when the incarnated soul at the time was deceived. Trust was betrayed and the result of this betrayal still resonates within the soul records. Fear makes one retreat and one cannot overcome the barrier of the new, of the unknown. And finally, this is perhaps still the worst situation that makes one fear precisely what can help each incarnated soul: THE RESISTANCE TO CHANGE. It is always more comfortable to stay where one is, for the place is already known and brings no insecurity, even if it is unfavorable. It is the famous situation that many verbalize: It is bad, but it is good. But it is necessary to trust! There is a Divine Plan for humanity. We have reached the Turning Point. It is necessary to take this step forward. Everything that happened until now was part of the learning, even if, at certain moments, the pain was very great. But the worst is over. How many times is this phrase being pronounced in current channelings! Trust the Plan! Another encouraging phrase! Another one: no one will go through what they do not need to go through! The fear of crossing the lines that demarcate what has been and what is to come needs to be overcome. They are the last tests that determine the qualification, or not, for those who wish to make their ascension. However, it is very sad to perceive the large number of incarnated who are reluctant to take advantage of the last opportunities for change. MANY FEAR WHAT CAN HELP THEM. It is a pity, for time is urgent! They may be losing what matters most to the soul in experience in this school: the real possibility of ascension. A little effort, confidence, and courage are enough for the change to actually happen in each one in these final times of Transition. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Last Barrier: Overcoming Fear",
        texto: "Beloved ones! The great marathon of the Third Dimension is coming to an end. Everything converges to the last obstacles within the Divine Plans that govern Planet Earth. Throughout the Ages, almost a hundred billion souls decided to experience bodily life subjected to the veil of forgetfulness, truly feeling as if they were disconnected from their higher versions and from the Source itself. This experience in duality in a Third Dimension World qualifies all the ascended to join the select group of Ascended Masters. We have already said here before that Earth is one of the hardest schools of souls. Originating from various parts of the Galaxy and even from outside it, souls came here to submit themselves to learning under the veil of forgetfulness. The Divine Plan reserves for this school the finalization of the great Cycle of Expiations and Trials. All the experiences offered have already been widely made available to all students throughout the millennia. The time has come! We are in the last years of the Planetary Transition. Among so many Trials, most likely overcoming fear is the last of them. When the soul began the wheel of incarnations here on Earth, fear already began to be part of its history. Feeling alone, disconnected from the Source and abandoned by everything, it is natural that it felt exactly like a child lost from its parents. And fear settled in and accompanied it through all reincarnations. We are in the last incarnation in duality here on this Planet. And if fear was the first obstacle, it will also be the last to be overcome. Many of you say you feel lost. Yes, such feeling is real. But soon, all those who are indeed feeling this will have the opportunity to free themselves from fear. Understanding the meaning of being here in this school; recognizing the proposed experience; assimilating the lessons offered; accepting the tests administered; in short, truly feeling like an interested student willing to learn makes it much easier in this final stretch. There is little left! Very little! The anxiety you feel is nothing more than the expectation of the soul that knows what it came for and where it will go. It knows that the long-awaited time is coming. Impatience and haste now become stronger. But it is absolutely normal to feel all of this. You just need to trust and understand that the purpose of your soul is being fulfilled. The fear that has always accompanied you in successive incarnations is now manifesting for the last time. Welcome it with love. Wrap it in your Light and let it go. Even though it seems like it was your greatest enemy, it was nonetheless a Master who taught you all the time. Creating obstacles that forced you to find solutions, it was also your ally in learning. But now there is no more need to feel fear. It is necessary to say goodbye to the old companion. Recognize its invaluable cooperation throughout the millennia, assimilate the lessons learned and get rid of the unnecessary weights. The path now takes another direction. Detaching from everything that before seemed indispensable. And the fear of lack, of scarcity, of loss and of so many other possibilities made us adopt fear as a necessity. A grave mistake. From now on, fear is nothing more than a parasite that got used to consuming your highest energy. It is time to separate from this unwanted company. Fear cannot enter the Portal of the New Earth. In the Fifth Dimension, the low vibration of fear does not have enough frequency to sustain itself. Say goodbye to fear and follow your last steps towards the 5D Portal. Earth's humanity has had the opportunity, since the beginning of 2020, to free itself from fear. Look how much has happened in these three years! Everything was a reason for each one to be able to feel the fears that were still hidden in their basements. I will not mention here every detail of every situation, but you can reflect and see for yourself how many opportunities to free yourself from fear you have had. In these last days, during a meditation, I was shown that humanity is being grouped into two very distinct situations: the group of those who are overcoming fear and the group of those who are not yet ready to overcome such trials. Certainly this can also determine the destiny of each one. Remembering that the teacher cannot interfere in the answers of the tests applied to their students. We are indeed in the final tests of a great Cycle. OVERCOMING FEAR IS ALSO THE LAST BARRIER! Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! The souls incarnated on this Third Dimension Planet have forgotten who they are, where they came from and what they came here to do. This is the rule in this School, for the learning is exactly this: to create something while the soul is subjected to the veil of forgetfulness. All souls came from the Light. Even those who before were in other worlds also of Trials and Expiations, long before were in Dimensions of 5D and above. Remembering that only a Fractal of an elevated soul can descend to Third Dimension worlds, for the risk of remaining in this low frequency range is very great. From the Light we came and to the Light we will return one day. Each one in due time, for there are no limited deadlines. What happens is that 3D Schools also make their Transition and, when that happens, souls need to migrate to other Schools still of the same level. So the exile of souls occurs, like those of Chapel who arrived here in times past. Now Earth is also making its Transition to 5D and will cease to be a World of Expiations and Trials. Upon passing to a World of Regeneration, the souls that achieved the highest frequency rise along with the New Earth. On the other hand, those not yet ready must leave it and face exile. The souls that are getting ready for ascension feel the changes in an increasingly intense way. They feel that something great is coming and they also feel an incredible need to transform themselves. Something very strong drives such souls to seek more knowledge and reasons for internal transformation. It is a thirst for knowledge that seems insatiable. Along with it also come uncertainties and anguish. Although the soul has much unconscious knowledge, consciousness still has all the experiences lived in this current incarnation. It also has the memories and records of the experiences of past existences in physicality. They are beliefs that still remain alive within each incarnated soul. Instinct is natural in every being. Like a compass that guides the walk, it often confuses, for it can indicate several directions at the same time. It is the influence of the mind addicted to what has already been experienced and lived throughout the successive incarnations of the soul. Timelines can overlap and create a tangle of situations and options. Everything needs to be resolved in this current incarnation. We came now to find the Line that leads to the 5D Portal. These are exciting and decisive times as well. Something great is coming and the soul knows it. Since we do not remember the divine project nor our own soul plan, it is natural that most incarnated now feel a great expectation, often transformed into deep anxiety. At certain moments, such anxiety can even turn into an unpleasant anguish. This is also one of the reasons for the increase in suicides. Others may feel a lot of anger, disillusionment, sadness, which can lead to deep depression or even madness. Therefore, we need to understand the current moment of humanity and the Planetary Transition. If this is the long-awaited moment since we accepted to come here to experience duality, why are we so distressed? If the best is yet to come, where is our confidence in the Divine Plan? If we have made it this far and the worst is over, why so much fear? The answers can be many, but the truth is only one. We are in the last hour of the night and darkness still prevents us from seeing the Light, but it will soon appear radiant like a new dawn. We still have the veils of forgetfulness wrapped around our consciousness; however, soon, one by one, all will be lifted quickly. It will then be the moment when we can remember who we really are. But until then, and this will not take as long as many believe, we still need to grope here and there in search of this long-awaited Light. Many still search for it disorderly. They keep going around and around, for they do not know which direction to follow. But the secret begins to be unveiled. And gradually, everyone will realize that THE LIGHT IS WITHIN EACH ONE. Do not seek anything outside of you! Just seek some parameters in order to locate yourself, for you carry all the necessary baggage for ascension. You have accumulated all the necessary experience in order to achieve the frequency of the New Earth. Search within this soul baggage and all the tools will be there. THE LIGHT IS THERE WAITING FOR YOU TO FIND IT. The Light is within you, for it has always been there. You never lost it! You just forgot that you always carried it with you. You came with it and with it you will return home. You just experienced the shadow while you forgot that you were always Light. You came to experience what it is like to create in a 3D world. You discovered that Light creates much more in Shadow than within the Light itself. YOU ARE THE LIGHT! YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN LIGHT AND WILL NEVER CEASE TO BE. Do not let yourself be involved by those who take pleasure in non-Light. Find reasons to feel the Light that you are. Do not allow the dark news to envelop you. Do not disseminate or share messages that hide the Light. Those of non-Light only have this tool left to maintain their survival on this Planet. Do not prolong their stay here. Do not feed such entities with low energy. You are Light, you just need to convince yourself of it! You do not depend on anything outside to achieve your ascension. Trust the Plan. AND TRUST THE LIGHT THAT IS WITHIN YOU! Namaste!",

        texto: "Beloved ones! Within the Plan of the Evolution of Worlds, Earth is leaving behind the frequency of Third Dimension, a vibration that has always accompanied it since its most remote history. We are entering higher frequency bands, where the lowest frequency corresponds to the Fifth Dimension. Everything was already foreseen, for in Divine time there is no linear time as we know it. What actually exists are energetic vibrations that correspond to certain frequency bands, known as Dimensions. The Third Dimension is considered an illusion, for the consciousnesses that inhabit it live a dual reality, that is, the polarities of everything that is possible in these worlds. In addition, there is the aggravating factor of the veils of forgetfulness, since without such forgetfulness no experience of duality would be possible. In 3D vibration, matter is predominant. Everything is coarser, heavier. Everything is carbon-based, for in this way, everything is impermanent. Carbon decomposes and then renews itself, as if it were reborn from itself. This partly explains the Wheel of Samsara, which is nothing more than the circle of reincarnations. There are an infinity of Third Dimension Worlds scattered throughout the Cosmos. Earth is just one of these homes. However, as we said before, everything follows the evolution determined by the Creator. Why would it be different in relation to our Planet? We do not yet have the knowledge nor the capacity at the current level of consciousness to understand the true history of humanity. However, as this consciousness expands, more and more information arrives and we are allowed to disseminate it, since they can also absorb such knowledge. Information would be of no use if no human being could understand it. Today, as the days pass, everything quickly expands. The veils are being lifted one by one and, in a short time, human consciousnesses will no longer be the same. We are in the last decades within the Planetary Transition, which has an estimated duration of 3 Centuries. It began around 1750 and, until today, most of the incarnated have had an average of three reincarnations within this transition phase. Thus, almost no one noticed the incredible changes that occurred during this period. But the last century, which also corresponds to the last of the three incarnations within the Planetary Transition, was indeed impactful. We will not place here facts already mentioned in previous texts, such as the opportunity of millions of hardened souls who reincarnated between 1950 and 1970 in order to have a last chance to redeem themselves and, thus, be able to inherit the New Earth. We will also not speak here of the coming of the souls classified as Indigo Children who came next. Nor of the Crystal Children who came after the Indigos, nor of the Star Seeds who are coming now, from 2012 to the present day. We will only talk about the Dissolution of the Third Dimension. Everything is funneling now. The last 50 years are the most incredible within these three Centuries. Already around 2001, GESARA was to be announced in September of that year. GESARA is a definition that corresponds to the exchange of all Systems in force in 3D, in order to adapt to the new 5D reality. The Hidden Forces that have always commanded humanity through labor and debt do not want the end of 3D, for they do not resist the new frequencies. Even though it is a Universal Plan, some human actions can advance or delay the processes, since everything is energy. So, retaliation was put into practice that September. You all already know the consequences. Even so, due to the expansion of collective consciousness, in 2010 Earth's Timeline was changed. Excluding the Armageddon Line, a new smoother and less painful Line was put into practice. This Timeline will prevail until the end of the Transition. So, by around 2050, there will be no trace left of the Old Earth. A time window of 25 years was created within this final period of 50 years. Such window corresponds to the year 2012, the year in which Earth fully entered the Photon Belt of Gamma Light, until the year 2037. This window determines the time in which the last transformations, which are also the most impactful, can occur definitively. However, the latest information coming through higher channelings reports that the most incredible years within the window will be the years between 2020 and 2026. So, hold on! We are in the Eye of the Hurricane. Even if perceptions are still a little dulled, there is no way not to see what has already come and, especially, what is still to come. Minds, even if still limited, will have to bear the new, for there is no way to ascend to the New Earth without living and understanding the new reality. Dormant consciousnesses will suffer a greater impact, for the change will shock those who do not want to wake up to the new reality. Just yesterday, a channeling said the following: Nothing that continues to vibrate in 3D will remain on Earth from now on. Of course, it will not be today or tomorrow that the incarnated souls that vibrate in 3D will leave Earth, but we can have a notion of the facts and understand that they will not have much time. This does not mean that everyone who disincarnates now will leave Earth. We need to understand that each one has a Soul Plan, which stipulates how long they need to be incarnated in order to execute it. When that time comes, the soul detaches from the body, disincarnates and returns to the astral. If it is at the frequency of the New Earth, it will return here later. Those who are not at the frequency will be taken to Planets still of Third Dimension, consistent with their soul vibration. Today's message also wants to bring some comfort to souls worried about the future. We have said before that the Light at the end of the tunnel is already being felt. We still have three incredible years ahead, but they will be the most decisive within these three Centuries mentioned in the text. Remembering that the Universe does not have a calendar, for it simply is NO TIME. However, as a parameter, we must place things in parallel within our perception of linear time. This makes it easier to make comparisons. The Third Dimension will cease to exist definitively soon. All the chaos we see is nothing more than the old energy fighting desperately for its survival. People attached to the illusion of matter, of 3D, of finiteness and of fear will have more difficulties from now on. Those who know that we are an immortal soul and who now have the opportunity to finally ascend to a higher frequency will increasingly feel the relief of a time that ends. Do not get into the drama of what will cease to exist! Do not cling to old beliefs or to matter. The time of Material Man no longer exists. The time now is of Spiritual Man. The time of competition also dissolves now. Only cooperation will prosper, for in 5D nothing will be as before. The Old 3D dissipates like mist on a spring morning. Celebrate! You are entering the Dimensional Portal that will take you to an incredibly better World! Namaste!",

        titulo: "The Crossing",
        texto: "Beloved ones! All souls that were willing to experience and learn on this Planet Earth knew perfectly well what the Divine Plan was for this Terran humanity. They knew each situation they would encounter and also knew all the steps they should take with each incarnation. And, above all, they knew that one day the learning would be concluded and the return home would be assured. So, you who are incarnated here on this Planet, are part of this group of souls that had the unique opportunity to be here. It has already been said before that only courageous souls accepted such an experience, for Earth is one of the hardest schools of souls in this Universe. Divine Plans are perfect. The consciousness of a soul incarnated here is so limited that there is no way to comprehend the magnitude of such Plans. Only after the total lifting of the veils will it be able to have the dimension and proportion of everything. And this time of revelations is already underway. Your consciousness is expanding rapidly now. You understand things today that you did not understand a year or more ago. The expansion process has accelerated to such an extent that what took centuries now takes a few years or even a few months. The process of expansion of consciousness is not the same for everyone. It has also already been said here that we are all on a staircase and each one is on the step compatible with their frequency, that is, with their capacity to absorb the changes that are occurring now. No one is given the opportunity of new knowledge if they do not have the capacity to assimilate such information. The Creative Source is the origin of everything that exists in the infinite OMniverse. It can also be called the Cosmic Central Sun. There everything is simply pure LIGHT! It is such a great loving consciousness that cannot be understood, so we say that this consciousness is GOD. Everything is created there, for everything emanates from there, that is, from the SOURCE. God, Source, Cosmic Central Sun, Light, Love, Energy, in short, a package that is summed up as a SINGLE CONSCIOUSNESS. You are a Divine Spark emanated from this Source. Through this Divine Seed-Atom, you became a Monad. You fragmented into many YOUs until you reached this Fractal of Soul so small, that you almost lost consciousness of who you really are. But this was necessary, otherwise you could not be here on this Third Dimension Planet. The Divine Spark or Seed Atom is indeed a powerful atomic force, such is its energy. That is why it can create Planets, Stars and Galaxies. And to inhabit these worlds outside the Source, it needs to break up into less atomic parts. So it divides into 12 Super Souls. Each one into 12 more and, even so, they remain in the condition of Super Souls. Only then does each Super Soul divide into souls. And to inhabit Third Dimension Worlds like Earth, the soul needs to divide into pieces of its own consciousness, that is, into Fractals. You who are incarnated here are one of these Fractals. Remember: you are a fractioned consciousness. That is why you do not know about the other higher versions of yourself. You have the sensation that you are disconnected from the Source, but this is not true. You just cannot remember yet. But the time of awakening is now. Gradually, you will remember things you never imagined knowing. This happens in proportion as your consciousness expands and integrates with your higher versions. The ascension process is always based on the integration of a lower consciousness by its higher version. We could compare a baby and a pair of pants of an adult man. While babies, several of them could be placed inside those pants. However, as they grow, they fit in ever smaller numbers, until in the form of an adult body what is inside is always only one body. This integration of the versions of the same previously fragmented consciousness is such a natural process that it will not cause any disturbance. You will always be yourself, just with a broader consciousness. You will never see yourself as two people as many imagine. It will be an improved, more evolved I. At this moment, many are in THE CROSSING between Dimensions. It is necessary to make this dimensional passage. The Portals are open and, to surpass them, it is enough to have the necessary frequency. The secret is knowing how to achieve the necessary vibration. No one can do this process for another. Guide yes, but interfere no. Each Soul Fractal will decide when it wants to make this crossing. In fact, when it is willing to make the necessary effort. Yes, an effort, for the crossing will require will, determination and preparation. No one will be carried in their lap or on their back. That is why it is a moment of decisions. You will be challenged in courage, determination, wisdom and, above all, in confidence. Yes, in confidence, for you have been prepared for hundreds of incarnations to be here and now ready to cross the last obstacles. Pay attention in these coming weeks and in the first part of next year. There will be immense challenges and so many attempts that will make you waver. The cheering of those who will not make the crossing to the Fifth Dimension will be deafening for you to feel fear and give up doing it. You will be tested many times, but know that you will never lack support. Everything around you may shake, but nothing will affect you if you remain confident in the Plan. Remember that the Divine Plan is not threatened by any human being, however powerful they may be. The powers of men never surpass the powers of the Creator, nor even your own powers, for you are a free soul. You are a consciousness and not a body as you believed until now. Nothing and no one can imprison a consciousness, for it has no material form. You are free as long as you can understand who you are. The illusion of the Third Dimension made you believe the opposite, but now the veils begin to be lifted and you gradually discover the truth. The truth sets free! The truth is the passport for this Crossing. That is why so many attacks happen as attempts to destroy the truth. But the Creator has already said ENOUGH! The times have come and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth for those who cannot make this Dimensional Crossing. Wonderful times for all those who did or do to deserve! Namaste!",

        titulo: "Action or Omission",
        texto: "Beloved ones! Many of you have questioned about two daily attitudes that bring some doubts regarding acting or not in certain situations. Despite the interest in increasingly understanding the role of each human being currently incarnated on Earth, as one understands how life is seen from a spiritual perspective, it seems that the more one knows, the less one is knowing. Many messages tell us that there are no mistakes, but what there actually is, is always learning. So, if we sin through acts and also by omission, obviously, we also learn through such attitudes. It seems like a paradox, but it is very difficult to separate the same action into two directions, for it can be both positive and negative. If we sin by acts or omission, we can also do good deeds through them. So where is the difference? Well, I would say it can only be in the intention. Many times we have already said here that everything is in the intention. It is the key that opens both the door to the Light and the door that leads to darkness. Therefore, when someone asks me how to know if they are on the path of ascension, I answer that I do not know, for if everything is in the intention, how could I know the intention of each one, in each act, action or intention? The answer also serves for those who say they do not know how to act in certain situations. Always do everything with the intention of good and everything will be well done. Even if the result is not as expected, at least you will have done everything that was yours to do. And this simplifies everything. Life is not complicated, what complicates is the interest that each one puts in each situation. Knowing when we should act or abstain is a matter of wisdom, not a matter of competence. And if we act with wisdom, then it is certain that we will not interfere with the free will of others. This is another key that we should never forget. By acting with good intention, we will be putting compassion and unconditional love into practice. And if we act only by guiding, we are respecting the free choice of the other. We should never make the choice for others! We should also not impose conditions or our will. Some even say they want to change the other or, at least, ardently hope that the other changes according to their convictions. This is nothing more than a pretense and, as such, is useless. There are many ways to learn and each one has their own. Helping when we are asked is still the best choice on our part. Making instructions available to those who are interested, without, however, expecting everyone to appreciate such devices is also a way to help without interfering with free will. As for omission, we can make the same parameter here in relation to actions. If we abstain when we actually have an opportunity to help someone, we are incurring in a lack of charity. Knowing when to speak up or when to abstain is also a demonstration of wisdom. Remember that wisdom and knowledge are not the same thing. Many times, omission is necessary and much more useful than action. For example, telling something to someone, whose information will trigger unnecessary pain and suffering, or will promote intrigues, arguments, revolt or revenge, besides the discord and hatred derived from all this. Abstaining can be the best choice in many situations. On the contrary, abstaining when we have an opportunity to help is a selfish act and generates reactions according to the Law of Cause and Effect. As we can see, the line that separates the positive and the negative of each attitude to be taken is really very thin. And, to make decision-making even more difficult, we need to take into account that others are also students of this school of souls and each one is at their own level of learning. In this school no one can take the tests for others. There is no cheating or any trick that can facilitate the climb of the soul's ascension ladder. When we remember the Divine Law, which says that no one will go through what they do not need to go through, it becomes easier to understand the other and also easier to know when we should act or abstain. Always remember that what works for you may not work for the other and vice versa. There are no two consciousnesses on the same step of the ladder. We are doing well in this final stretch of the long journey of life and, despite the illusory appearances of the 3D mind, we see great changes in consciousness in a good part of humanity. Incredible times bring all the necessary opportunities now. Watching and praying also serve those who want to take advantage of every opportunity to elevate themselves. The moment is no longer for the clever, but for the awakened. Use your wisdom and simplify your life and the lives of others as well. Namaste!",

        titulo: "Where Do Simple and Ignorant Spirits Come From?",
        texto: "Beloved ones! When Kardec codified Spiritism, he brought comfort to incarnated souls, since humans began to understand that life continues, even with the death of the physical body. In a way, humanity received a thread of Light in their consciousnesses, for understanding that death does not exist for the soul was indeed a great achievement in terms of knowledge for each incarnated here on Earth. Even so, Kardec's Spiritist Doctrine was limited to the Wheel of Reincarnations. All those who were interested in studying it interpreted that each human being is a simple and ignorant Spirit in search of improvement and evolution. In a way, this is correct, serving as comfort to those who strive in this evolution. Once all the lessons of this school of souls are learned, the cycle of reincarnations ends. But there was always a doubt: WHERE DOES ALL THIS BEGIN AND WHERE DOES IT END? It took almost two Centuries for human consciousnesses to at least begin to understand what goes beyond Kardecism. Gradually, when one understands something more than such doctrine, an infinite range of information emerges, bringing more and more information about who we really are. First we discovered that we are not a Spirit, but a soul fragmented from the Spirit. We are a Monad, that is, an unlimited consciousness, created in the Divine Source, as a DIVINE SEED-ATOM. This is the true Spirit, our HIGHER SELF, made in the image and likeness of the Creator, for He Himself is a Consciousness, the Source itself, what can be called GOD. Who is God? De-EUs (Of-YOUs), that is, the sum of all the YOUs, which is in fact everything that exists in the infinite Cosmos. He is the tree that created all the seeds. We are all seeds. And to spread, populate and create worlds, each Seed-Atom divided into 12 Super Souls, then into 12 more still Super Souls. Subsequently, each Super Soul divided into Souls and these, in turn, into Fractals to be able to reach the lower worlds. Therefore, who is incarnated as a human being on Earth is a Fractal of soul, that is, a tiny part of each monadic consciousness. Some previous texts have already been written here, explaining what Monads are like. So, the fractal is the smallest part of a consciousness that can still return to its higher version, without completely losing its monadic connection. Even subjected to the veil of forgetfulness, it will ascend when it has all its experiences here on this Planet. It was said that being in a World of Duality, of Expiations and Trials, is the farthest point a consciousness can experience life. Today, we begin to understand that this is the point where reason still accompanies consciousness, even subjected to the veils, but it is not yet the farthest point from the Source where parts of consciousnesses have permission to go create, learn and evolve. We have also said here before that, at the end of learning, these experiences are integrated into our higher soul versions. And this is carried forward until it reaches our HIGHER SELF, which is indeed the individualized Spirit. Once such experiences arrive there, they are also integrated into the WHOLE, for each Spirit is part of the greater Consciousness, unique as Source, that is, the Creator Himself: God. (OF YOUs). Having seen this, the souls incarnated on Earth, even limited, are consciousnesses provided with reason. They are aware of their acts and can decide, through their free will, each decision to be made. It is these decisions that advance or delay their evolution, and also the time they must remain here, in order to complete their learning purpose. Because they have this consciousness and reason, we cannot classify such souls as Simple and Ignorant as we believed until now. Certainly other channelers have also received information from Above on the subject addressed here. However, I was instructed to post the subject today, in order to bring to you who do not yet have such information about it. The point is that the souls incarnated on Earth have already come as Fractals of higher versions; therefore, they cannot be simple or ignorant. They are only subjected to the veil of forgetfulness. God does not create worlds as we believed before. Those who create are His Seeds. Remember the phrase: Go and multiply; create and populate the worlds. So, wherever a small Fractal of each Higher Consciousness is, it will be bringing Light to every place. It is the Light that creates, even in its smallest particle. And if God is Light, the Source is Light, you are Light. You are and always will be part of the Divine Seed-Atom. So, if each soul incarnated on Earth is a part of this Light, it cannot be simple and ignorant as we understood. Today I was given another part of our own Monad that I did not even imagine existed: our even lower versions, which cannot even be considered fractals, for they are such a tiny part of our consciousness, that they are not even possessors of reason. This part of us is materialized in the form and condition of Kingdoms lower than the human, that is, in the mineral, vegetable and animal Kingdom. We already knew that such Kingdoms were also consciousnesses, even in a primitive and evolving form, but we did not have the information that they are parts of each Monad to which we also belong. Even being consciousness without reason, each animal, each vegetable and each mineral particle is a version of us that went to experience life in those conditions. Each consciousness of these Kingdoms one day evolves from mineral to vegetable; from vegetable to animal; and then from animal to human. Upon arriving in human form, it acquires the condition of soul, adding reason to consciousness, and it is at this stage that it passes to the condition that was called Simple and Ignorant Spirit, for this process is the reverse of the incarnated soul that descended directly from a higher Dimension. This soul coming from the Lower Kingdoms brings the experience that no soul coming from above can take to the Higher Self. Once taken to the Source, everyone can know and understand what such experience is like, for we are all ONE in this Source. When we study Genesis, we have a lot of information about the evolution of worlds, but there is always some complementation missing, which I believe can only come when we have the capacity to understand such complexities. Our current consciousness is rapidly broadening and this facilitates the understanding of what is coming. One of the reasons why many souls come from Higher Dimensions to experience life in a Third Dimension World is, undoubtedly, to bring support to these evolving souls, also called Simple and Ignorant Spirits. Glorious times these that we live now! With each passing day, more information arrives. Thus, we will quickly finalize the assembly of the great puzzle that is this incredible work of the Creator. Each of us is a piece of this game. Praises be given at all times, for the revelations are already visible on the horizon line. I am Vital Frosi and my mission is enlightenment. Namaste!",
